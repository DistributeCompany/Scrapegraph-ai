108871,Resolving Conflicts between Rolling Stock and Crew Planning at NS through Deadhead Optimization,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108871,"This thesis addresses conflicts between rolling stock and crew planning by formulating a mixed-integer program (MIP) for planning deadheads. Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) recently introduced crew time blocks to ensure that crew working hours fall within predefined time ranges. However, in the current planning process, deadheads, which are used to rebalance rolling stock are not planned with respect to these time blocks. As a result, some deadheads cannot be performed by crew, leading to planning conflicts. This problem, referred to as the Rolling Stock Rebalancing Problem with Deadhead Trips and Crew Planning (RSRP-DT-CP), is addressed by decomposing it into two subproblems: a Multi-Commodity Flow Variant Problem (MCFVP) and a Deadhead Timetabling and Crew Planning Problem (DT-CPP). Computational experiments show that, for the North-Holland network, no imbalances could be resolved under the current restrictions, whereas for the national netowrk, 1-2 imbalances could be addressed. Relaxing deadhead time restrictions allow 1-2 imbalances to be resolved in North-Holland and 5-10 in the national network. These results indicate that some rolling stock imbalances can be resolved, though limited structurally by planning regulations and crew duties.",Master Industrial Engineering and Management (M-IEM),"Haasewinkel, M.",October 2025,English,"Yes.

108870,Developing a Multi-Metric Dashboard to Enhance Interpretation of B2B Customer Training Evaluation Data at Baker Hughes,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108870,"This research shows how a multi-metric evaluation tool can provide deeper insights into participant feedback beyond a standalone Net Promoter Score analysis in B2B customer training at Baker Hughes. The dashboard was developed using a Design Science Research approach and integrates the Net Promoter Score (NPS) with eight predefined complementary metrics, structured around Kirkpatrick’s evaluation framework. Human-computer interaction (HCI) principles guided the design to support information retrieval, trend identification and interpretation of how participants perceived training sessions. Task-based usability testing with the dashboard showed strong results, with a task completion rate of 92% and a System Usability Score of 87.75%. The User Experience Questionnaire indicated positive user experience, although variation in pragmatic interpretation suggests areas for refinement. Secondary qualitative feedback confirmed the dashboard’s value and highlighted opportunities to improve interactivity and to integrate more qualitative insights. Overall, the realized dashboard provides a deeper understanding of training participant feedback by integrating multiple evaluation metrics with NPS through a design tailored to stakeholder needs at Baker Hughes. This enables well-informed, actionable decision-making that facilitates targeted improvements across the B2B training portfolio.",Master Interaction Technology (M-ITECH),"Bertana, A.",September 2025,English,"No

It also identifies astate-guided networked governancethat combines strong vertical mandates with targeted horizontal coordination, clarifies how national goals are operationalised at city level. Overall, Karamay's energy transition is underway but remains in an intermediate stage, characterized by evident path dependence and a tension between external pressures and internal drivers such as CNPC's Green and Low-Carbon Development Action Plan and municipal initiatives like hydrogen industry alliancess. Achieving a deeper, structural transformation will require sustained efforts to enhance governance resilience and promote technological diversity. As policy recommendations, this study suggests breaking down departmental silos to strengthen cross-sectoral coordination; increasing financial and technical support for enterprise-driven low-carbon innovation (especially pilot projects in niche technologies); streamlining approval processes to accelerate deployment of low-carbon projects; and expanding workforce training to help oil-industry workers adapt to new energy technologies.

108865,Analysis and Testing of ECMO circuits to develop a consensus for neonatal and paediatric circuit set-up for clinical trials,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108865,"The Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation (ELSO) Consensus Group aims to standardise paediatric and neonatal Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) circuit set-ups for clinical studies to ensure safety and data comparability. This research supports that goal by analysing four common circuit variantsin vitro, focusing on air handling, haemolysis, and wash-out behaviour. Using standardised, clinically relevant components and flow rates, the study tested various configurations under clinically common pressure conditions. Haemolysis testing showed negligible difference between adult and neonatal or paediatric circuits, as haemolysis is a combination of multiple factors, such as the level of the shear forces the erythrocytes are exposed too, as well as the duration and reoccurrence of the load. While neonatal and paediatric circuits present with higher shear rates, adult circuits present with a bigger reoccurrence of the load, especially when using a shunt line in the circuit. The balancing of these factors cancels each other out, making the difference in haemolysis negligible. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, negative pressure at the pump inlet did not generate air bubbles through the oxygenator via a bridge line. However, high circuit resistance, particularly in more complex setups, required high pump speeds that likely increase haemolysis. The analysis also highlighted a common practice: connecting a bridge line to the oxygenator's de-bubbling port. While this prevents air embolisms from reaching the patient, it risks damaging the pump. Adding a bubble trap to protect the pump introduces new problems, including increased resistance and a higher potential for blood damage. Finally, wash-out tests revealed non-ideal flow patterns within the oxygenators. The longer-than-expected clearance times suggest the presence of stagnant zones, which are known to promote clot formation and create a harmful shear environment for blood cells. Ultimately, the assembly of an ECMO circuit for this patient cohort presents a series of trade-offs. The utilization of components designed for adults is considered suboptimal because it can induce significant haemodilution, in comparison to appropriate devices. Additionally, the associated low-flow conditions generate zones of low shear stress in these oxygenators, which are conducive to increased thrombosis.",Master Biomedical Engineering (M-BME),"Belo de Azevedo, M.",October 2025,English,"No.

108864,Lead time improvement of the vulcanization department within Wouter Witzel along with an exploratory review of possible contributions that AI could have in the improvement workflow,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108864,"Wouter Witzel is a company specialised in the production of butterfly valves, which takes place in theirproduction facility in Losser. What makes the butterfly valves of Wouter Witzel stand out on the market,is the fact that the rubber lining is vulcanized into the metal house rather than vulcanized separately andplaced into the metal house. This vulcanization process takes place in Wouter Witzel´s vulcanizationdepartment. The aim of this research is to make the vulcanization department more efficient, with themain goal being: ’to reduce the lead time of the vulcanization department by 10%’. On top of this, thepotential use of AI in a lead time reduction process is explored.This process is started by examining the current department’s workflow and performance, after whichimprovement opportunities to further increase the found performance will be developed. The effect ofthese improvement opportunities will be validated through the use of a discrete event simulation inSiemens Plant Simulation. Based on this, an implementation plan will be developed through whichthe improvement opportunities can be implemented. It was found that the process performance andequipment availability were bad performing KPIs. In an attempt to increase these, several concepts weredeveloped. From these, the preheating of houses and SMED seemed to be the most promising. Theseconcepts entail a preheating step before the vulcanization process for the houses and moulds respectively.By doing a discrete event simulation of both concepts, it was found that only one concept was able todecrease the lead time. The two concepts combined caused an increase in lead time of 2%. Even thoughonly one concept was able to reduce the lead time, both concepts could result in a financial profit forWouter Witzel. Hence it was decided to develop an implementation plan for both concepts and calculatethe financial effect of these. With the investment costs being AC 170.724, functions for the payback periodand ROI in 5 years were established based on the oven’s hourly rate. In the worst case, the hourly rateof the oven is AC 10. This would result in a payback period of 90 weeks and an ROI of 167%. Using thecurrent (somewhat unrealistic) oven’s hourly rate of AC 0,11, a payback period of 32 weeks and an ROIof 667% were found.As the lead time reduction process carried out is quite labour intensive, potential use cases of AI inthe process have been explored. For all four steps, several AI technologies have been examined on theirapplicability within the lead time reduction process. It was found that AI could significantly contributeto the analysis of the current department. The main reason for this, is the fact that this part of theprocess is largely related to data. With tools for AI data pre-processing, AI data transformation andAI process mining, the analysis could be done more efficiently. On the other hand, AI was not found tobe easily applicable in the other three steps of the process. The main reasons for this were the lack ofstructured datasets and the need for human expertise. The use of AI does not add value to the process,whenever the same (or more) human expertise is needed. Based on the ongoing research regarding AIin discrete event simulation, it is expected that an AI tool which could contribute to this will becomecommercially available soon.

108862,Exploring the impact of AI on improving fraud detection and risk mitigation in European SMEs,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108862,"This study examines how European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) adopt and integrate artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to improve fraud detection and risk mitigation. While AI has been widely studied in large organizations, evidence on its application within SMEs remains limited,particularly in the context of financial fraud. Little is known about which AI tools SMEs actually deploy, how these tools affect detection effectiveness, and which organizational and regulatory barriers influence successful adoption. This study seeks to fill this gap by providing empirical evidence on SME adoption of AI in fraud detection. The study employs a qualitative, exploratory design based on semi-structured interviews with Dutch SMEs from various sectors. Data was analyzed through inductive thematic analysis, allowing patterns and themes to emerge from the participants’ experiences and perspectives. The methodology enabled in-depth exploration of adoption drivers, barriers, and perceptions, while also acknowledging the limitations of a small, single-country sample. The findings indicate that AI adoption, applied to improve fraud detection and risk mitigation, among SMEs is still at an early stage. What is described as AI often turns out to be modest digitalization tools or lightweight automations, such as invoice scanners, time-tracking apps, no-/low-code workflows, or generative assistants, that improve efficiency and process discipline, but do not perform autonomous fraud detection. These tools remain supplemental and supporting rather than replacing human judgment. The main barriers of adoption come down to bad data quality, limited technical knowledge, high costs, and uncertainty about regulations. Still, value can be created when companies take a balanced approach: keeping people in the loop, starting small, and putting effort into getting their data in order. This study adds new real‑world insights into how SMEs are actually experimenting with AI for fraud detection. The study concludes that while full-scale integration remains rare, SMEs can benefit by focusing on practical gains rather than radical change. The key recommendation is that investing in data infrastructure today is the most critical step SMEs can take to prepare for AI’s expanding role in fraud detection and risk management.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Leijssenaar, M.",October 2025,English,"No.

108861,A Need for Speed: Development of an automated measurement of the intima-media thickness with tomographic 3D ultrasound in patients with giant cell arteritis,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108861,"Introduction:Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) requires time-sensitive diagnosis to prevent irreversible vision loss. Intima-Media Thickness (IMT) assessment of large arteries, in particular the axillary artery, is a reliable sonographic diagnostic marker for GCA. Yet manual 2D measurements are operator-dependent and labour-intensive. Tomographic 3D ultrasound, combined with an automated segmentation algorithm, could provide rapid and reproducible IMT assessment across the entire artery. This thesis aims to develop and validate a segmentation algorithm for IMT measurements from 3D ultrasound in the axillary artery. Method:A hybrid segmentation algorithm integrating edge detection, Kalman filtering, and local adaptive thresholding was developed. Performance was assessed in (i) a parameter sensitivity analysis (process noise Q, measurement noise R); (ii) a vessel phantom study with a known wall-thickness; and (iii) an in vivo volunteer study (n=10). Metrics included the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean Hausdorff distance, root-mean-square error (RMSE), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for repeatability, and Bland–Altman bias/limits of agreement (LoA) versus manual segmentation. Results:The algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.96, a mean Hausdorff distance of 0.08 mm, and an RMSE of 0.13 ± 0.02 mm when performing the parameter sensitivity analysis, with stable tracking using Q = 0.01 and R = 5. The phantom experiments confirmed high agreement with manual measurements but revealed sensitivity to non-physiologic echogenicity, complicating its generalizability. In vivo, automated IMT remained below the axillary GCA cut-off (1.0mm) in all healthy volunteers, with good-to-excellent repeatability (ICC = 0.70–0.82), and a small bias versus manual measurements (0.10 mm). Conclusions:Automated IMT segmentation from 3D ultrasound is an accurate and reliable method, offering reduced operator dependence and near-real-time assessment. Prospective patient-level validation and multicenter calibration are the next steps to establish diagnostic performance and clinical impact.",Master Technical Medicine (M-TM),"Vrielink, B.G.",October 2025,English,"No

108857,Design and Implementation of an Extremum Seeking Controller for Simultaneous Position and Force Tracking,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108857,"Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires balancing accurate motion execution with compliantforce regulation. Traditional controllers achieve this through task-specific parameterization, or with the use ofpredefined models of the environment stiffness. However, traditional methods lack adaptability when conditionschange.This thesis proposes a controller based on extremum seeking control (ESC) as a model-free alternative thatoptimizes a cost function combining position and force references in real time. Using the Franka Research 3 (FR3)robotic arm in simulation, ESC was benchmarked against a weighted hybrid position/force controller on flat andcurved surfaces with varying compliance. Performance was assessed through the root mean square error (RMSE)of the kinematic and force tracking.On flat surfaces, ESC consistently outperformed the hybrid controller in trajectory tracking, particularly atmedium and high stiffness levels. While the hybrid controller maintained closer force values in low-stiffnessconditions, it suffered from oscillations and instability as stiffness increased. ESC produced smoother forceregulation but with reduced accuracy under high stiffness. On curved surface, where simultaneous satisfactionof position and force references was not possible, both controllers exhibited unstable behaviour and large forcepeaks, indicating that neither approach generalized effectively in highly nonlinear contact conditions.The findings show that ESC offers a promising and adaptable framework for contact-rich robotic tasks instructured environments, outperforming traditional hybrid control in trajectory tracking without requiring priorenvironmental knowledge. At the same time, the limitations observed on curved surfaces highlight the need forfurther development. Future work should emphasize validation on physical hardware, extension to more complextasks through online adaptation of tuning parameters or alternative cost function designs, and integration withimpedance-based or learning-based approaches to enhance stability and generalization.

108855,From Burst Suppression to  Alpha Rhythms:  Simulation-Based Inference  on a Microscale EEG Model,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108855,"Background: After cardiac arrest, many patients enter a coma. EEG is an important tool for predicting the recovery of these patients. One of the patterns present in 50% of the postanoxic EEGs is burst suppression (BS), a pattern characterized by alternating high-voltage bursts and low-voltage suppression. There are two types of BS: identical BS (IBS), where bursts are nearly identical and linked to poor prognosis, and heterogeneous BS (HBS), where bursts varyin shape and lack such prognostic value. This suggests that the underlying neuronal networks are fundamentally differentially affected. The neuronal mechanisms that generate IBS and HBS,and how they differ from networks producing healthy EEG activity (e.g. alpha rhythms), remain poorly understood. Understanding these mechanisms could clarify the prognostic differencebetween IBS and HBS and pave the way for novel treatments. Computational models provide a non-invasive approach to investigate these mechanisms. However, existing models have so far failed to reproduce HBS, limiting our insight how and why IBS and HBS morphologically and prognostically differ. Approach: In this study, we develop a biologically motivated model of 2000 adaptive integrate and-fire neurons to simulate IBS, HBS, and healthy alpha rhythms. The model includes parameters at the cellular, synaptic, and network levels, which can help explain how these EEG patterns arise and differ. To systematically identify the values of 26 parameters that reproduce each EEG pattern, we construct a simulation-based inference (SBI) pipeline. Results: We present the first computational model capable of simulating IBS, HBS, and alpha rhythms. Its simulations closely resemble these EEG patterns. The inferred parameters underlying these simulations reveal a high degree of degeneracy: many distinct parameter combinations produce similar EEG dynamics. This degeneracy makes it challenging to pinpoint the exactmechanisms distinguish IBS, HBS, and alpha rhythms. Nonetheless, specific parameters consistently differed between IBS, HBS, and alpha activity. These parameters suggest a hyperexcitableneuronal state in IBS and reduced synaptic strength in HBS. Conclusion: This work provides a foundation for investigating the mechanisms that differentiate IBS, HBS, and healthy EEG activity. It highlights the challenges of interpreting the degenerate, high-dimensional parameter values found by SBI.

108854,Supporting University Teachers in Teaching Professionals: A Cognitive Task Analysis and 4C/ID-Informed Design Study in the Context of Lifelong Learning Initiatives at the University of Twente,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108854,"Universities are increasingly expected to support lifelong learning (LLL), yet many educators lack specific support on how to effectively teach adult professionals. These learners typically have prior work experience, unique motivations, and limited time, which traditional teaching approaches may not adequately address. The research questions were: 1) What are the core skills and knowledge that experienced university educators apply when teaching professionals in LLL context? 2) How can these findings be used to support novice educators when transitioning into teaching in LLL settings? To address them, a Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) was conducted through semi-structured interviews with 15 experienced educators at the University of Twente. Data was coded to identify a hierarchy of constituent skills, required knowledge, and factors of complexity, which then informed a training blueprint, using the Four-Component Instructional Design (4C/ID) model. Findings highlighted key constituent skills across three phases: preparing instructional units, lesson preparation, and lesson enactment. Core skills include defining learning goals, designing lesson components and allocating time, pre-class communication, conducting opening session, integrating interaction with lecture input, and managing group activities. Comparison with van Dijk et al. (2020) on regular university teaching revealed overlaps, such as adapting to different learner levels, but also LLL-specific skills like intensive small-group facilitation, coordination across multiple instructors, and eliciting professional learners’ experiences.

108853,Measuring Trust in Automation: Evaluating Frontal Alpha Asymmetry as a Neural Marker in Human-AI Interaction,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108853,"Trust in artificial intelligence (AI) systems plays a critical role in high-stakes decision-making contexts, yet its neural underpinnings remain poorly understood. This study investigated whether frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA), an EEG-derived index associated with approach-avoidance motivation, can serve as a neural marker of trust during human-AI interaction. Participants engaged in a mushroom classification task, receiving AI-generated recommendations with manipulated reliability (100% vs. 50%) to induce states of trust and distrust. Behavioral results confirmed successful manipulation: participants reported significantly higher trust and aligned more with AI suggestions under the high-reliability condition. Despite this, FAA differences between trust and distrust conditions were not statistically significant at the individual level, and no consistent correlations were found between FAA and behavioral or self-reported trust measures. These findings suggest that FAA may not directly capture trust when it is primarily driven by cognitive evaluations of AI performance, rather than affective or motivational states. The mismatch between behavioral and neural measures highlights the complexity of trust and points to the need for alternative neural indices, such as parietal alpha desynchronization, mid-frontal theta, or ERP components, as well as multimodal and context-sensitive approaches, to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying human–AI trust.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Mayer, J.R.",September 2025,English,"No

108850,The Effect of the Social Context on Recovery from Daily Stressors,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108850,"Stress is a significant health challenge. Thesocial context(i.e. presence of others) as well asproblem-focused coping(i.e. actively addressing the problem) have already proven to help dealing with stress, and interaction effects might also be present. However, most studies of this kind have relied on retrospective or cross-sectional methods instead of longitudinal daily-life assessments of stress recovery. This study aims to investigate how social context predicts stress recovery and whether problem-focused coping moderates this relationship. Solitude is expected to impact negatively on stress recovery, and problem-focused coping should help to reduce such an impact. Participants completed 10 questionnaires per day over eight consecutive days; the Experience Sampling Method was used. Participants self-reported on stress levels, coping strategies, and recovery. The results showed that the levels of stress recovery did not significantly differ across social context situations, and the interaction effect between the social context and problem-focused coping was found to be non-significant as well. Problem-focused coping alone also did not predict stress recovery.

108849,The Impact of River Dune Geometry on Flow Resistance,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108849,"Flow resistance in rivers strongly influences hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and riverbed evolution. A major component of this resistance arises from the roughness of river dunes affecting turbulence and energy dissipation. Although advanced turbulence models have led to an improved understanding of the interactions between dunes and flow, most operational hydraulic models still rely on simplified empirical relationships that overlook the combined effects of dune geometry parameters such as dunesteepness (H/L) and slipface angle (θ), limiting their accuracy under complex real-world conditions. The present study investigates how multiple dune geometry parameters combine to influence flowresistance. Previous research has examined these parameters in isolation, but their combined effects remain unexplored. To address this, a Two-Dimensional Vertical (2DV) Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) model was developed in the OpenFOAM platform to simulate flow over dunes and analyze how geometry governs hydraulic resistance. The model was validated against high-resolution laboratory measurements of velocity and turbulence over fixed dunes with slipface angles of 10°, 20°, and 30°. Two turbulence closure models (k–ε, k–ω SST) were tested in both wall function and wall-resolving configurations. Accuracy, measured by the Mean Relative Error (MRE) in streamwise velocity (⟨u⟩), vertical velocity (⟨w⟩), and Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) (⟨k⟩), was similar for all configurations (5.8 to 8.4% for ⟨u⟩ relative to experimental profiles). Based on its theoretical suitability, the Low-Re k–ω SST model with the Knopp et al. (2009) roughness extension was selected for further simulations, which resolves boundary layers and recirculating regions at an acceptable computational cost. The model was then applied to investigate flow resistance over smooth dune geometries, characterized by curved profiles and gradual transitions between dune parts, which better reflect the shapes observed in natural rivers. Flow resistance was quantified by separating the form drag coefficient (Cf), obtained from pressure integration over the dune surface, from the skin friction drag coefficient (Cs), calculated by integrating the viscous and turbulent shear stress along the bed. A one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis identifiedH/Landθas the dominant contributors to drag. Subsequently, these parameters, together with the relative dune height (H/h), were examined in a systematic multivariate analysis to assess their combined effects. The results showed thatθandH/Lhave a nonlinear influence on the total drag coefficient (CD), which is the sum ofCfandCs, with amplification occurring when both values are high, partly due to a downstream shift in crest location with increasingθ. The effect ofH/hwas secondary, becoming important mainly under two conditions: at highH/Lbut moderateθ, increasingH/hintensified flow separation through a stronger adverse pressure gradient, and at highH/Landθ, it promoted earlier flow reattachment through increased turbulence intensity. These findings demonstrate that flow resistance over dunes is governed not only by individual geometric parameters but also by their combined effects, particularly the interplay ofH/Landθ. Building on this, a quadratic predictor equation was derived from these two variables that compactly represents their nonlinear interaction and explains almost all variance inCD(R2 = 0.97). Together, these results highlight the limitations of existing empirical predictors and of studies that vary parameters in isolation, while providing both a method and an initial quadratic predictor equation for dune-induced flow resistance that can be refined and extended in future work.

108847,Van klik tot invloed: Hoe digitale participatieplatforms lokale besluitvorming en inclusiviteit van participatie beïnvloeden in Nederland,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108847,"Burgers hebben tegenwoordig meer inspraak op beleidsvorming, omdat overheden niet meer in staat zijn om alle maatschappelijke problemen zelfstandig op te lossen. De toenemende inzet van digitale participatieplatforms door Nederlandse gemeenten heeft nieuwe mogelijkheden gecreëerd burgers te betrekken bij beleids- en besluitvorming. Desondanks bestaan er in de literatuur lacunes in de kennis over de daadwerkelijke effectiviteit en inclusiviteit van deze platforms in de context van Nederlandse gemeenten. Zonder zorgvuldige implementatie bestaat het risico op ineffectiviteit en schijnparticipatie, wat het vertrouwen en de democratische legitimiteit kan schaden. Dit onderzoek beoogt inzicht te krijgen in de bijdrage van deze platforms aan de inclusiviteit van burgerparticipatie en de lokale besluitvorming. Hierbij wordt onderscheid gemaakt tussen verschillende typen platforms, namelijk gemeentelijk ontwikkelde open source platforms (bijv. OpenStad), commerciële SaaS-platforms (bijv. Go Vocal, Mett) en gemeenschapsgerichte platforms met participatiefunctie (bijv. Mijn buurtje, Hoplr). Middels een kwalitatieve onderzoeksstrategie, gebaseerd op literatuuronderzoek en half gestructureerde interviews met acht gemeenteprofessionals en vier platformaanbieders/ontwikkelaars, zijn de variabelen digitale participatieplatforms, inclusiviteit van participatie (toegankelijkheid en representativiteit) en besluitvorming (proces en uitkomst) geoperationaliseerd en onderzocht. De bevindingen tonen aan dat digitale participatieplatforms een positieve bijdrage kunnen leveren aan inclusievere participatie en beter onderbouwde besluiten. Ze kunnen erin slagen een grotere en diversere groep te bereik dan klassieke fysieke methoden. Met name de stille meerderheid, jongeren en jonge gezinnen maken gebruik van het tijd- en plaatsgebonden karakter van de platforms. Succesvolle inclusiviteit wordt echter niet automatisch behaald; dit vereist een hybride participatiestrategie die digitale middelen combineert met fysieke participatiemethoden, fysieke ondersteuning voor minder digitaal vaardige groepen, het gebruik van toegankelijke content (in duidelijke taal) en het aanpassen van de communicatiestrategie aan de doelgroep. Wat besluitvorming betreft, dragen de platforms bij aan een transparanter proces door projectinformatie te centraliseren en functionaliteiten zoals tijdlijnen en directe publicatie van resultaten te bieden. Essentieel voor het vertrouwen is consistente terugkoppeling over hoe de input is gebruikt, ook wanneer deze niet is overgenomen. De mate van invloed op de uitkomst is projectafhankelijk. Directe, bindende invloed komt voornamelijk voor bij concrete projecten. Bij complexe, abstracte beleidsprojecten, die over het algemeen minder respons genereren, is voornamelijk indirecte invloed zichtbaar.Voorafgaand aan elk traject is het cruciaal om duidelijk de mate van invloed vast te stellen en hier transparant over te communiceren om valse verwachtingen en schijnparticipatie te voorkomen. Verder blijkt dat de variatie in bijdrage aan inclusiviteit en besluitvorming niet afhangt van het type platform, maar van de manier waarop de gemeenten het platform inzetten, de interne processen en de politieke wil. Dit onderzoek biedt gemeenten praktische aanbevelingen om hun participatieprocessen te optimaliseren door de platforms effectief in te bedden in hun bredere participatiestrategie. Wel moet hierbij rekening worden gehouden dat participatie altijd maatwerk is. Gemeenten moeten daarom hun strategie en implementatie bijstellen aan hun specifieke context. Ook de aanbevelingen moeten daarom contextspecifiek worden toegepast.",Master Public Administration (M-PA),"Huisman, S.E.",September 2025,Dutch,"No

Using the CIMO framework, embedded within Keskin & Romme’s design theory, the study integrates literary review and interviews conducted with University of Twente Students, in the development of mobile-app features, connecting theoretical findings and practical applications. The findings reveal that individuals with dietary restrictions struggle with both physical risks, such as cross-contaminations, and social-emotional distresses, such as anxiety and fear of exclusion, when dining out. The proposed solutions center around the proposition of a mobile-app that provides individuals with dietary restrictions the information they require to safely dine out. The key design features for the mobile-app include clear and complete dietary information, comprehensive list of nearby FBOs, social engagement features, and transparent and reliable information sourcing. A co-creation session allowed for a more customer-centered approach to the solutions, receiving direct feedback on the designed features. By understanding and addressing the issues faced when dining out, this thesis bridges the gap between academic research and practical technological applications, providing actionable insights for dietary restricted customers and food service operators in the EU.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Takatsu Fonseca, P.H.",February 2025,English,"No

To address this challenge, the EU aims to promote lifelong learning, including through initiatives such as European University Alliances offering micro-credentials. This thesis examines the implementation of micro-credentials within 11 European University Alliances, based on qualitative interviews and document analysis. The study contributes novel empirical evidence on how European University Alliances navigate the complexities of offering micro-credentials, responding to an urgent need for research in this emerging area. Drawing on the Theory of Change, Europeanisation theory, and the European approach to micro-credentials, the study analyses institutional responses and identifies key challenges. The findings show that while European University Alliances are committed to offering micro-credentials, they face obstacles related to national regulatory differences, internal challenges, quality assurance, recognition of micro-credentials, and funding. Addressing these challenges is essential for policymakers and universities to ensure the effective implementation and success of micro-credentials in European University Alliances.

108843,When reputation meets misinformation:  A qualitative case study in higher education,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108843,"The increasing prevalence of misinformation poses a significant challenge to the reputation of organisations. In today’s digital age, prospective students often rely on information available online when making their study choices. However, it is important to consider the possibility that the information available online may not always be accurate. This leaves higher education institutions vulnerable to the spread of false or misleading information. Previous studies on higher education reputation have largely focused on the experiences of current students and staff, leaving the perceptions of prospective students on reputation underexplored. This study addresses that gap by examining the intersection of misinformation and reputation management in higher education through the lens of the Situational Crisis Communication Theory. Using a qualitative approach, the study involves semi-structured interviews. Nine participants were exposed to the website of a hypothetical University of Applied Sciences, then were exposed to a video containing misinformation about this institution, followed by a set of interview questions. The participants came from various countries: Spain, Singapore, Germany, Pakistan and India and were recruited via Reddit forms. Afterwards, the participants were shown a video from the University of Applied Sciences using a diminish response strategy, followed by the same set of interview questions to discover their perception of the institution’s reputation. The results reveal how quickly reputational damage can occur when prospective students are exposed to misinformation. In line with SCCT, participants responded strongly to a YouTube video in which a supposed student framed the institution as intentionally misleading by sharing misinformation. Presenting facts with statistics and partnerships did not improve how they perceived the reputation of the hypothetical institution. The findings show that even recalling evidence fails to improve the perceived reputation when credibility is in doubt, pointing to authenticity in the response as a boundary condition.",Master Communication Science (M-COM),"Dijkhuis, B.",September 2025,English,"No

108842,An Application of ObRE to Elicit Ethical Requirements: A Case Study in the Green Credit Domain,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108842,"The rise of Green Credit as a financial product for promoting sustainability has increased the dependence on ESG ratings to guide lending decisions. However, current ESG ratings are often inconsistent, opaque, and difficult for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to meet the standard, creating risks of unfair treatment and greenwashing. These challenges highlight the need to integrate ethical principles into the early design of the Green Credit Risk Assessment System. This thesis applies the Ontology-based Requirements Engineering (ObRE) method to address this need. Using ObRE, the study models the context of Green Credit, its key stakeholders, and four ethical principles: Beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and explicability. From this modeling, a catalog of ethical requirements is developed and validated through expert interviews to assess the validity and relevance. The validation shows that the proposed artifacts are understandable, practical, and useful to strengthen the governance and transparency of the future system. Experts highlighted that they help make ethical intentions traceable, reveal conflicts early (such as the tension between fast approvals and thorough checks), and improve accountability in Green Credit processes. The study concludes that embedding ethical requirements through the ObRE approach offers a structured way to improve trust and fairness in the Green Credit Risk Assessment System. Although further work is needed to expand the principle of fairness and test the method in a real-life project, the thesis delivers validated ethical requirements and lessons learned for practitioners",Master Business Information Technology (M-BIT),Yusmaira,September 2025,English,"No

Drawing on cases from water governance (Ahr Valley floods, Doñana aquifer depletion) and extractive conflicts (Hambach lignite mining, Retortillo uranium project), this study examines how local histories of sudden disasters, slow‐onset degradation, and imposed extraction shape demands made by social movements. Water movements emphasize technocratic, data‐driven frames and cooperative governance, mobilizing volunteers, scientific monitoring, and EU legal precedents. Extractive movements deploy moral‐rights language and combine direct action with strategic litigation to challenge corporate‐state collusion. Coalition structures range from institutionalized multi‐stakeholder forums to ad hoc alliances, reflecting each context’s political opportunity. Across all, a forward‐looking justice ethos prevails, prioritizing prevention over restoration and embedding ecological and social repair within democratic accountability.

Although informal learning is very valuable because it is context-specific and closely aligned with teachers’ own needs, it often stays personal and invisible within schools. The aim of this research is to examine which strategies teachers perceive as most effective for sharing informally learned knowledge. A survey was conducted among 33 teachers working in (special) primary, secondary, and vocational education. The survey combined closed and open questions, and the responses were analysed with descriptive statistics and thematic coding. The results show that teachers mainly share informally learned knowledge through informal networking and reflective dialogue. Of these, reflective dialogue was found to be the most effective strategy because it allows for deeper exchange and collaborative learning. Lack of time was the main barrier, while trust, openness, and collegial culture strongly supported knowledge sharing. The conclusion is therefore that schools should create time and space for accessible and trusted conversations so individual informal learning can be translated into collective professional growth.",Master Educational Science and Technology (M-EST),"Wilmink, A.",September 2025,English,"No.

Although its aggregation is often described by the canonical misfolding pathway, in recent years more evidence was gathered for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) as an alternate mechanism through which aggregation occurs. LLPS is thought to occur in the crowded cell environment, where αS forms dense droplets known as condensates. Recently, the earlier stages of both pathways were found to be quite similar; both starting with liquid-like nanoscale αS assemblies. This raises the question to what extent the nanoscale αS assemblies are comparable to microscale condensates, and if nucleation and aggregation happens through similar molecularmechanisms. We studied the mobility and differences in conformational space in nano- and microscale condensates of αS. We achieved this using various techniques including ensemble FRET, single-molecule FRET, Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), single particle tracking (SPT), fluorescencecorrelation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). In our study on nanoscale αS assemblies, we found indirect evidence of multimeric nanoscopic condensates in solution, but did not observe a difference conformational space. For microscale condensates, we established differences in conformational space in different regions and quantified the mobility of different components. In general, there were multiple indications of heterogeneity in the LLPS system. The experiments described in this thesis are the first towards creating and studying microscale LLPS assemblies of αS at NBP. They open up the way for more research on αS in such systems.

From this point of view, the current EU asylum system lacks the guarantees to protect both the cohesion of the system itself and the Union, as well as to adequately protect migrants in need who may be displaced by climate-related events, which could, in turn, trigger an institutional crisis. By doing a content analysis we found that the inability of the European Union to provide legal recognition, humanitarian aid and long-term integration can be understood because of process failure in the agenda-setting stage combined with program failure in implementation and a highly motivated politization. These failures are motivated by the political situation and the increasing polarization.

108834,Brand activism in the Netherlands: Exploring how Dutch companies approach taking a public stance in social issues,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108834,"Purpose:Brand activism (BA) is gaining significant attention in society and in companies.While earlier research mostly focused on the impact on BA consumers, such as the effects on consumers’ behavioral intentions, perceptions of authenticityand their responses to BA, less research has been done from an organizational perspective. Particularly, there is limited research on how companies approach taking a public stance on social issues through BA. To address this gap, this study examines how companies in the Netherlands approach taking a public stance through BA, focusing on diversity and inclusion (D&I). Methods: This research conducted two qualitative methods: a content analysis of publicly available materials from 15 Dutch companies and 11 interviews with four company representatives and six D&I-experts. Results:Companies often strategically implement D&I initiatives to align with their mission, vision, and values. These include internal initiatives and external initiatives.Creating awareness and facilitating an open dialogue on D&I within companies are essential for achieving perceived authenticity. The key drivers were influenced by ethical values and perceived business benefits as well as political pressures, societal trends and compliance with EU regulation and legislation. Conversely, companies face barriers such as internal resistance, fear of consequences, financial constraints, and risking backlash when taking a public stance. Participants expect that companies will shift the term “D&I” to broader and less polarizing concepts. Conclusion: The findings show that taking a public stance on social issues through BA involves more than just making this stance. It calls for strategic implementation, alignment, and authenticity to navigate the barriers and risks.

Conversational AI (CAI) has proven effective in educational settings, however its potential in industrial settings, where higher precision and reliability are required, remains underexplored. This thesis explores the potential of conversational AI (CAI), particularly voice-driven digital intelligent assistants (DIAs), in supporting industrial training in a pharmaceutical context. Specifically, this study investigates how two design dimensions–AI persona (Expert Operator vs. Machine) and voice embodiment (Diegetic vs. Disembodied)–affect usability, cognitive load, trust, and task performance during manual operation. A functional prototype using the OpenAI RealTime API was developed, and evaluated through a 2 × 2 within-subjects user study with nine domain-relevant participants: both novices and expert operators. Based on self-reported data from structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, results indicate no single optimal DIA configuration for all users or contexts. The Expert Operator persona was generally preferred for trust and engagement, while the Machine persona provided clearer instructions for some users. Diegetic voices were perceived as more intuitive, but disembodied voices improved focus and privacy. These findings highlight the need for flexible, user-adaptive CAI designs that accommodate individual preferences and experience levels.

Relational parsing, a new technique for parsing, leverages Brzozowski derivatives as building blocks for parse forests. It offers a theoretical advantage, but lacks real-world validation. This thesis bridges the gap between the academic theory of the relational parsing algorithm and the practical implementations of it, by porting and analysing two independently constructed implementations in a single Kotlin environment. Within this thesis, benchmarks allow us to explore the characteristics of this algorithm under different conditions. These show an interesting result, while relational parsing is conceptually elegant, naive implementations might suffer from severe memory consumptions. The main contribution of this thesis is the improvement of the two existing implementations. With the help of new data structures, we are able to minimize the required memory footprint.

108829,Promoting transactive dialogue using transactive prompts:  Exploring the impact of single transactive prompts and follow-up transactive prompts in a serious game imparting knowledge about cybersecurity on knowledge gain and the level of transactive dialogue,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108829,"Background:Transactive Dialogue is strongly related to higher learning success. However, groups often do not reach the higher level of a transactive dialogue. Therefore, there is a need to discover how to change that. Objectives:This study examines how transactive dialogue can be fostered, as reaching higher levels of such dialogue enables students to fully exploit the potential of collaborative learning. For this purpose, a collaborative serious game on cybersecurity was developed, designed to promote transactive dialogue among German 12th-grade high school students through the use of transactive prompts. The study specifically investigates the effectiveness of single transactive prompts (STP) and follow-up transactive prompts (FTP) on both knowledge acquisition and the transactivity of dialogue. Methods:The study used a quasi-experiment design with 53 German 12th-grade high school students as participants. The participants were divided into two conditions. In the condition one (only STP) they worked only with STP and in condition two (STP and FTP together) they worked with STP and FTP. Data was collected via two parallel qualitative knowledge tests, before and after the intervention and audio data was recorded during the game play. The data was analysed using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney-U test, a Spearman correlation and a robust ANCOVA. The Mann-Whitney-U test was performed to test whether STP and FTP together facilitates reaching higher level of the transactive dialogue, expecting STP and FTP in combination to facilitate reaching higher level of the transactive dialogue. The Spearman correlation was used to test whether a higher level of transactivity in a dialogue relate to higher knowledge gain, expecting the higher level of transactivity in a dialogue to foster knowledge gain. The ANCOVA was carried out to test whether STP and FTP together foster knowledge gain, expecting STP and FTP in combination to promote knowledge gain. Results and Conclusion: It was expected that STP in combination with FTP promote transactive dialogue and knowledge gain. The results of the study were not in line with the expectations. The results suggest that the STP and FTP together are not sufficient to systematically foster neither knowledge gain, nor the transactivity of a dialogue and that further research should be conducted with a different research design and other data collection methods.",Master Educational Science and Technology (M-EST),"Hempel, I.",September 2025,English,"No

108827,The ability of crop models to simulate the impact of climate extremes on crop yield,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108827,"Extreme climate events are becoming an increasingly critical factor in European agriculture, with droughts, heatwaves, and pluvial floods posing severe risks to wheat production. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate how two widely used crop models, the process-based AquaCrop and the empirical Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZ) model, simulate yield responses to such extremes. The research focused on four contrasting European regions (Portugal, Ireland, Poland, and Sweden) over a 30-year period (1990–2019), applying return-period analysis to identify 1-in-5-year and 1-in-30-year extreme events. Model simulations were compared against long-term averages and historical yields.The results show that drought was the most consistently damaging extreme across all regions, in line with previous studies such as Beillouin et al. (2020), who reported widespread yield losses during the 2018 European drought. AquaCrop consistently captured strong yield reductions during drought events, sometimes exceeding 300% decreases relative to the long-term average in Portugal. AEZ displayed a more muted response, underestimating the severity of drought-induced losses but remaining stable across different conditions. This finding echoes Molina Bacca et al. (2023), who highlighted that empirical models tend to smooth variability, limiting their ability to capture short-term anomalies.Heatwaves were found to have weaker and less consistent effects on simulated wheat yields. AquaCrop sometimes overreacted to heat stress, producing unrealistically large yield increases or decreases depending on location and soil type. AEZ, by contrast, often registered minimal or even positive yield anomalies, suggesting limited sensitivity to heat extremes. This aligns with Schauberger et al. (2017), who emphasized that while heat can accelerate maturation and reduce grain filling, its effects are highly dependent on timing and regional context. In cooler climates like Ireland and Sweden, heat events above the 31 °C threshold were rare, limiting the models’ ability to demonstrate responses.Pluvial flooding presented the greatest modelling challenge. AquaCrop showed highly variable results, with yield differences swinging between sharp losses and surprising gains. This instability likely reflects its lack of explicit flood modules, which makes the model interpret high rainfall as either beneficial or detrimental depending on soil conditions. AEZ, meanwhile, applied modest penalties to yields under flood conditions, but the magnitudes remained small, often less than −30%. These findings resonate with Tao et al. (2020), who argued that flooding impacts are underrepresented in most crop models due to the complexity of simulating waterlogging and secondary effects like plant disease.When compared to observed yields, both models showed partial alignment but also significant discrepancies. AquaCrop tended to overestimate drought losses, while AEZ often underestimated them. In some cases, neither model reproduced observed anomalies, underscoring the challenge of simulating local-scale extreme impacts. These mismatches support Schewe et al. (2019), who cautioned that both over- and underestimations are common in extreme-event modelling.The thesis concludes that AquaCrop offers valuable insights into drought sensitivity, but its volatility requires careful calibration. AEZ provides more conservative estimates, making it suitable for large-scale assessments, but its lack of responsiveness limits accuracy under extreme conditions. A hybrid approach, combining AquaCrop’s sensitivity with AEZ’s stability, could provide more balanced projections. Future improvements should prioritize drought calibration, localized parameterization, and the explicit integration of flood and heat stress mechanisms.Overall, this study demonstrates that while current crop models can capture some aspects of climate extremes, neither is sufficient on its own to reliably guide climate adaptation strategies. For policymakers and practitioners, this highlights the importance of interpreting model results cautiously and combining insights from multiple models to better plan for resilience under increasingly frequent and severe climate extremes.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"de Wolde, L.W.J.",September 2025,English,"No

108826,Identification of Startups as Suppliers: A Quantitative Analysis of Startup Search Practices,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108826,"External knowledge sourcing is important in the pursuit of innovative business ideas. One of thesesources are startups, that have emerged as key contributors to innovation and dynamic market approaches. As new ventures, they are often characterized by their experimentation and radical innovation methods, making them attractive sources of knowledge for firms in many different industries. This paper provides insight into how firms can successfully identify startups as potential suppliers. A core contribution of this study is to research the design and implementation of a systematic startup identification process, which integrates both a qualitative and quantitative evaluation method. The qualitative aspect is derived from literature, whereas the quantitative analysis is performed in this study. The process included a structured data collection method using an online web-survey conducted among purchasing professionals. A significant part of this paper involves a quantitative assessment of various independent startup identification variables in relation to the success of startup identification, where an in-depth frequency analysis and logistic regression are performed. This study shows that so called “pull” search instruments have a significant effect on the success of identifying startups, whereas “push” instruments and use of a systematic search process don’t. Furthermore, this paper provides insight into what the selection process of startups looks like, and which collaboration models are used by firms. Building on the underlying theories of the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities theory, this study contributes to literature on external knowledge sourcing and successful startup identification.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Ruis, S.J.J.",September 2025,English,"No.

108823,Knee abduction and internal rotation moments as risk factors for ACL injury in female athletes; Insights from OpenSim and IMU data,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108823,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are among common injuries in handball and football. Knee abduction moment (KAM) and knee internal rotation moment (KIRM) have been proposed as biomechanical risk factors, but their combined association with injury risk is unclear. This study examined whether combined moment parameters during cutting maneuvers are more strongly associated with ACL injury risk than peak KAM (pKAM) alone, and evaluated the feasibility of estimating three dimensional knee joint angles with inertial measurement units (IMUs).Prospective cohort cutting data from elite female players (n = 804; age: 20.90 ˘ 4.00 years; height: 169.61 ˘ 6.43 cm; weight: 66.34 ˘ 7.97 kg) were processed in OpenSim to calculate pKAM, pKAM plus KIRM at pKAM and pKAM plus maximum KIRM within 100 ms after initial contact. Injury registration data identified new ACL injuries during follow-up. Mean values for all parameters were higher in the injured group, but no statistically significant associations were found in group comparisons or logistic regression models.A laboratory-based validation study with four participants (2 male, 2 female; age: 23.50 ˘ 1.00 years; height: 174.60 ˘ 11.25 cm; weight: 72.35 ˘ 11.04 kg) compared IMU- and motion capture–derived kneeangles during a handball cutting maneuver. Motion capture data were processed in OpenSim to compute knee flexion, abduction and rotation angles. For the IMU data, raw quaternion orientations from seven DOT sensors were processed using a segment-to-sensor calibration. IMU-based knee angles were then calculated from the relative orientations of the thigh and shank segments. A synchronization procedure ensured temporal alignment with motion capture data. Flexion angles showed acceptable accuracy, whereas abduction and rotation angles showed large errors.With the current methodology and predictive parameter definition, neither pKAM nor its combination with KIRM can be used to identify female athletes at risk of ACL injury. Further methodological improvements in IMU sensor calibration, axis alignment, and joint axis estimation are required before the IMU DOT system can be used for injury risk screening in field-based settings.

This means that their product should convey the experience that they want to present to their user, and that the manufacturing is scalable to the company. The need for up-to-date products is the set-up for the assignment addressed in this thesis: redesigning OneThird’s lightbox.The lightbox is a prototype created for the purpose of ensuring homogeneous circumstances for taking pictures of fresh produce with a smartphone. This data is then fed into an algorithm in order to predict the shelf-life and batch quality of said produce. The product has experienced some issues within its current life cycle, such as being tedious to assemble, being quite large, and being stuck to a power outlet. In order to get a broader overview of the problems that exist within the prototype, the redesign started with an analysis phase in collaboration with the major stakeholder groups. Two fields that appeared promising, Design for Assembly (DfA) and modularity, were chosen for an in-depth dissection through literary research. This fed into a list of potential added value which the redesign could attempt to fulfil: the inclusion of modularity, improvement of (trans)portability and data consistency, and the increase in production volume, usability, and product lifespan.What followed is an iterative design process, using familiar methodologies. Using rapid prototyping and feedback from various stakeholders, a final design was reached which was converted into a prototype. Final improvements were deduced from this model, after which recommendations on final improvements are given. This thesis concludes with a recommendation on how the new and improved lightbox can be rolled out to ensure full functionality while fitting within the company’s goals.

108817,Negotiating Trust in Hyperreality: How Users Engage with Deepfakes on Social Media,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108817,"The digital age has transformed the way individuals perceive reality. The experience of digital content is distorting our sense of what is real and what is fabricated. Jean Baudrillard (1981) once described this as hyperreality—a state where the distinction between reality and simulation dissolves and the simulation becomes more real than reality itself. As a phenomenon recently relevant more than ever, hyperreality manifests in diverse modern forms: from AI-generated art to virtual influencers and digital twins. Deepfakes, a popular manifestation of hyperreality, are AI-generated media that may shape people’s perceptions of trust and authenticity. Their impact prompts questions about how individuals assess, challenge or accept potentially fabricated content. To address these questions, this study explores how social media users negotiate trust in digital content when engaging with deepfakes. The focus lies on users’ responses to and discussions surrounding deepfake content within the social context. Drawing on Baudrillard’s (1981) hyperreality, Giddens' (1991) theory of trust and Gee’s (2005) discourse analysis framework, this research employs a qualitative methodology. It utilizes a hybrid approach of online focus groups and dyadic interviews, exposing participants to diverse deepfake examples to capture their discursive strategies in negotiating trust. Applying discourse analysis, the study uncovers how language and socio-linguistic patterns shape perceptions of credibility and authenticity in digital environments. The findings illuminate the dynamic construction of trust in the era of deepfakes, where individuals actively engage with and even anticipate alternative realities. One of the study’s key contributions is the separation of message and medium: Users may believe messages despite distrust in the medium. Moreover, trust is shown to have strong emotional dimensions, characterized by desire, confirmation, and betrayal. Ultimately, the paper contributes to developing media literacy strategies for critical digital content assessment and points out the societal and ethical implications of trust in hyperreal media.",Master Communication Science (M-COM),"Raufi, M.",September 2025,English,"No

Yet prior research rarely examines the integration of OPEX paradigms and offers limited evidence from energy firms. This study looks at how OPEX practices that focus on efficiency affect the development of dynamic capabilities in energy companies. The research aims to identify the enablers that allow OPEX initiatives to support long-term adaptability and resilience. By doing so, the study aims to improve the understanding of how OPEX relates to dynamic capabilities in a rapidly changing environment. Design/methodology/approach:The study uses an exploratory qualitative design. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with OPEX practitioners from six large energy companies. The Gioia methodology is used for inductive analysis; interview data were coded into a structured framework of first-order concepts, second-order themes, and aggregate dimensions, revealing the connections between OPEX practices and dynamic capability development. Findings:The analysis identified four aggregate dimensions that explain how OPEX shapes dynamic capabilities.Continuous Improvementfosters a learning culture and openness to change, especially when combined with flexible processes, helping organisations deal more effectively with challenges.Capability Buildingemerged as another critical driver: systematic investment in people through technical training, leadership development, and empowerment of frontline staff strengthens resilience and autonomy, making adaptation quicker.Integration of Methodologies, where Lean, Agile, and Six Sigma are combined, can deliver efficiency while keeping flexibility, though this requires careful coordination to avoid confusion.

This thesis explores the knowledge dynamics of Venture Studios, that is, how knowledge is created, shared, transformed, and applied. The study draws on established knowledge management frameworks, such as Nonaka and Takeuchi’s SECI model and the related concept of ‘Ba’. Using a qualitative and explorative research design, 16 semi-structured interviews with senior leaders of Venture Studios were analyzed through the GIOIA methodology. The findings reveal that Venture Studios are intentionally designed to manage what this thesis conceptualizes as the ‘’Art and Science’’ paradox: the interplay between tacit (intuitive, experiential) and explicit (structured, codified) knowledge. This dynamic cycle involves generating tacit ‘’Art’’ through rich social mechanisms, systematically translating it into explicit ‘’Science’’ of playbooks and processes, and then internalizing this ‘’Science’’ to develop deeper forms of intuition and expertise.

Like many Dutch hospitals, ZGT faces increasing pressure from an ageing population and staff shortages, resulting in frequent mismatches between OR demand and available capacity. These mismatches cause inefficiencies such as idle time, cancellations, and last-minute schedule changes, highlighting the need for more accurate forecasts. Two forecasting approaches were developed and compared: a traditional time series model based on historical surgery requests, and a machine learning model that incorporates outpatient data such as consultation type, diagnosis code, and physician activity. Both were validated on hospital data using rolling cross-validation. The results show that the machine learning approach, with Random Forest and XGBoost as the best-performing models, generally outperforms traditional models, with MAPE values ranging from 9.9% for general surgery to 27.4% for plastic surgery. Translating forecasts into operating hours revealed that specialties with stable demand (general surgery, urology) can be predicted accurately, while specialties with higher variability (gynaecology, plastic surgery) remain more challenging.

108811,Assessing the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on the development of scour holes at bifurcations,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108811,"This thesis researched how hydrodynamic conditions influence the formation and development of scour holes at two major bifurcation points in the Dutch Rhine-Meuse delta: the Pannerdensche Kop and the IJsselkop. These bifurcations play a crucial role in water division across the Rhine branches and are subject to complex interactions between flow, sediment transport, and morphology.The main research question was: ‘’How do the hydrodynamics of the river influence the formation and development of the two scour holes at the bifurcation IJsselkop and Pannerdensche Kop?’’ The main research question was addressed by answering three sub-questions. These focused on the long-term morphological development of the scour holes, the relationships between discharge, water depth, flow velocity, and scour characteristics, and a comparison between scour hole behavior of the two bifurcations with a scour hole at the Kinderdijk confluence.Bathymetric datasets and hydrodynamic conditions data were analyzed using both quantitative and visual trend methods. Scour hole characteristics, such as maximum depth, volume, and surface area, were measured over time and linked to these hydrodynamic conditions. Trendlines (LOWESS) and distance correlations were used to quantify relationships, while the visual trend analysis compared the timing of measurements with the hydrodynamic conditions and scour hole characteristics to reveal temporal patterns.The results reveal that scour hole behavior is strongly location-specific. At the Pannerdensche Kop, the scour hole volume has increased significantly over the past two decades, mainly due to increasing maximum depth. High-flow events result in a temporary reduced maximum depth, followed by slow recovery to the original depth under normal-flow conditions. These high-flow events appear to influence sediment distribution, which may partly explain the dynamic response of the scour hole at the Pannerdensche Kop. The IJsselkop shows less responsive changes to the hydrodynamic conditions, with mainly the volume and area increasing during high-flow events without significant deepening. In both locations, the weir at Driel was found to influence flow division. This indicates that the weir operation even has an influence 23 km upstream at the Pannerdensche Kop. At the IJsselkop, also the seidment division is highly influenced by the weir and therefore influence local scour hole behavior. Furthermore, differences in bed material composition seem to play a role: the finer median sediment diameter at the Pannerdensche Kop likely contributes to its higher morphological activity compared to the coarser bed material at the IJsselkop. A comparison with the Kinderdijk confluence demonstrated that the confluence shows far less dynamic scour hole development. This highlights that scour processes at bifurcations and confluences are fundamentally different, with distinct hydraulic and sedimentary drivers influencing the morphological development of the scour holes.The study also reflects critically on data limitations, including missing observation dates, scarce measurements during extreme events, and inconsistent temporal resolution. Despite these constraints, the results emphasize the importance of high-resolution monitoring and localized analysis for understanding bifurcation morphodynamics. This research contributes to a better understanding of erosion processes at bifurcations and provides practical insights for river management. Future studies should extend the analysis to other bifurcations to explore whether consistent patterns emerge across different bifurcations or whether responses remain dominated by differences in local dynamics.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"Ommert, F.D.C.",August 2025,English,"No

108809,CSR Communication: The role of brand personality and consumer skepticism in corporate social responsibility,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108809,"Abstract Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a key part of organizational strategy, yet its credibility depends on how consumers interpret brand motives. This thesis examines how brand personality (warmth vs. competence), CSR message focus (people, planet, profit), and consumer skepticism interact to shape perceptions of CSR authenticity. A 3x2 between-subjects experiment was conducted using Tony’s Chocolonely (warmth) and Heineken (competence) as manipulation brands. A total of 211 participants were randomly exposed to one of six CSR messages and rated perceptions of authenticity, skepticism, warmth, and competence. Results showed that warm brands were perceived as more authentic than competent brands, and that consumer skepticism strongly reduced authenticity perceptions. Message–brand fit, however, did not moderate these effects. Across both brands, people-focused CSR messages were rated as more authentic than profit-focused ones. This suggests that the type of CSR message used is more telling for perceived CSR authenticity than message-brand fit.Contrary to expectations, competent brands appeared somewhat more vulnerable to skepticism than warm brands, though this trend was not statistically significant. The study extends CSR communication research by showing that perceived sincerity outweighs strategic fit in authenticity judgments. For practice, it suggests that brands should emphasize warmth cues and people-centered initiatives to strengthen CSR credibility, while competence-oriented brands may need to invest more in transparency and trust-building to mitigate skepticism.

108804,"Understanding Populist Success: A Comparative Analysis of Germany, Poland and the US",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108804,"The increasing success of populist parties and actors over the past decade has sparked public debate and increased concerns about the resilience of liberal democracies. Germany, Poland and the United States differ significantly in their institutional set-ups and their historical and societal contexts, but have witnessed the same trend of populist movements simultaneously. This poses a challenge: Why have populist parties or actors managed to achieve electoral success across such diverse circumstances? Scholarly debate regarding this phenomenon has drawn different explanations. Reaching from economic insecurity, cultural concerns and political distrust up to system unresponsiveness. Each highlights important approaches to the understanding of populism. Nevertheless, no single factors explain the simultaneous rise across different democracies. This thesis contributes to reality by combining demand- and supply-side perspectives in a comparative design. By analysing how economic insecurity, cultural concerns and political distrust interact with system unresponsiveness, it offers explanations for populist success for a deeper understanding of this phenomenon. At the same time, it explains how to deal with the challenges liberal democracies are facing across diverse democracies. Leading to the research question:What combination of factors explains the simultaneous rise of populist movements across Germany, Poland and the US? This qualitative study follows the Most Different System Design (MDSD) as a case selection strategy. Germany, Poland and the US were analysed across two periods each, one with and without success, using public data from the last 15 years. The results were ultimately compared using two hypotheses, with each sub-hypothesis testing the combination of factors most likely leading to populist success. The results showed that neither demand-side nor supply-side factors alone were sufficient to explain populist success. Instead, supply-side factors were necessary for populist success, while demand-side factors were sufficient only in combination with supply-side failure. For Germany and Poland, the strongest drivers were cultural backlash and political distrust, combined with supply-side failures. In the US, all demand-side grievances existed already, but addressing the two-party system's void required system unresponsiveness and a charismatic leader who capitalised on demand-side grievances. The thesis concludes that future research must pay more attention to institutional responsiveness in addressing societal insecurities to safeguard liberal democratic norms.",Master European Studies (M-ES),"Boels, M.K.",September 2025,English,"No

108803,When Bedtime Becomes Screen Time: Exploring Rationales for While-In-Bed Procrastination Applying the Temporal Self-Regulation Theory,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108803,"Background.Smartphone use in bed before sleep is a prevalent phenomenon among young adults, often resulting in compromised sleep duration and sleep quality, threatening health, well-being and performance. Smartphone use in bed can be understood as an expression of While-in-Bed Procrastination, which is the delay of sleep initiation after getting into bed while engaging in other digital or non-digital behaviours instead.Methods.This qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews on 11 university students to primarily investigate if the Temporal Self-regulation Theory is a suitable framework for understanding motivational aspects in WIBP and in explaining the discrepancy between intention and behaviour. A secondary emphasis explores practical strategies participants have implemented, as well as potentially helpful strategies for managing WIBP. Findings.The findings suggest that the Temporal Self-regulation Theory explains WIBP behaviour well. However, an additional factor of Psychological Need Satisfaction, as derived from Self-determination Theory, has been found relevant for fully understanding WIBP. Further, several potentially valuable strategies have been identified that have helped or might help individuals managing WIBP. Conclusion.This study is the first to investigate While-in-Bed Procrastination after the reception of this phenomenon by Magalhães et al. (2020). The findings of this study imply the need for future re-evaluation of the Temporal Self-regulation Theory components for WIBP behaviour. Quantitative studies can investigate the relationship strength of identified factors on intention and the intention-behaviour gap. Discovered strategies could further direct future research in developing effective management strategies.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Hohlfeld, N.M.",September 2025,English,"No.

While many studies either simplify riverbeds as flat or capture natural bed topographies, few explore idealized point bar geometries as an intermediate, generalizable approach. This study evaluated the role of idealized point bars in analyzing the hydrodynamics of open-channel bends. The study was expanded with a parametric analysis into the effect of bend sharpness, channel width, and arc length on the flow. To perform the analyses, this study used Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The numerical model utilized the RANS equations with an anisotropic Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) for turbulence closure. This lesser-known model was validated against experimental measurements from literature in a bend with a rectangular cross-section and benchmarked against the isotropic k-epsilon model. Results showed that RSM and k-epsilon captured the mean velocities equally well, but there were differences in the stresses. k-epsilon overpredicted turbulent kinetic energy by 105\%, where RSM overpredicted by 154\%. However, RSM predicted the bed shear stress distribution and magnitude accurately, compared to k-epsilon, which overpredicted peak bed shear stress by 53\%. After validation, the model domain was expanded with an idealized point bar and compared to experimental results of a mobile bed geometry. Results revealed that the idealized geometry was able to capture the increased transverse flow and downward advection of high inertial flow, but failed to capture the correct zone of flow separation. Results of the parametric analysis of planform variables indicated that reducing the bend radius increased peak shear stresses, while widening the channel reduced velocities and shear stresses. Examining the balance between centrifugal and gravitational influences showed a maximum imbalance near 90 degrees along the curve, a value which remains constant throughout the tested range of planform variables. Limiting the arc length to this value enhanced velocities and shear stresses at the downstream exit. The model results were compared to a remeandering case study, and some of the observed erosion and sedimentation patterns, as well as a case of bank instability, were explained by results from the parametric analysis.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"Meinen, J.G.",September 2025,English,"No.

108799,A Particle-Based Simulation of Aquisense®,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108799,"The Hydraulic Profiling Tool - (Anisotropic) Mini Pumping Test (HPT-(A)MPT), using the Aquisense® probe, enables rapid in-situ measurement of horizontal and vertical permeability by injecting water during cone penetration. However, this injection may trigger failure processes in the soil matrix, such as hydraulic fracturing and fluidization. These phenomena can disturb the soil structure and compromise measurement accuracy. The objective of this study is to achieve a detailed understanding of soil-water-probe interactions during the HPT-(A)MPT process so that it can be optimized and improved, with a specific focus on developing a deeper knowledge of failure mechanisms during the test. A particle-based numerical model is developed in YADE, combining the Discrete Element Method (DEM) with a Pore Finite Volume (PFV) approach to simulate coupled fluid–solid interactions. The model is verified against analytical solutions for 1D consolidation and 2D Darcy flow. Two model configurations are used. First, a simplified Single Point Injection (SPI) setup is applied to isolate the effects of soil parameters and injection rate on pore pressure, hydraulic conductivity, and effective stress. Next, a Full Model of the HPT-(A)MPT test is used to qualitatively compare the simulation results with experimental observations. Sensitivity analyses with the SPI model show that intrinsic permeability and injection rate are the dominant factors influencing failure. A log–log linear relationship is found between failure time, distance from the injection point, permeability, and injection rate. Low permeability or high injection rates result in elevated pore pressure and hydraulic conductivity near the injection point, leading to a reduction in effective stress and loss of soil strength. This can trigger matrix failure, or in more extreme cases, fluidization. Different failure mechanisms are more easily distinguished by monitoring mean and deviatoric stress rather than horizontal and vertical stress, as the latter tend to decrease simultaneously, whereas deviatoric stress decreases earlier in time. Simulations with the Full Model indicate that both HPT and MPT produce realistic hydraulic responses. However, in the HPT, the mechanical response is affected by penetration velocity, while the MPT shows that fluid injection induces permanent changes in soil structure. Depending on the conditions, this can either strengthen or weaken the soil, potentially affecting the accuracy of in-situ measurements. Therefore, it is recommended to apply corrections to measurement data in order to compensate for changes in soil structure induced by fluid injection. Additionally, adapting the injection rate in real time based on the measured permeability may help to prevent failure and improve test accuracy. Further research is suggested to enable quantitative interpretation of simulation results and to increase the practical applicability of the HPT-(A)MPT process.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"Peek, A.K.M.",September 2025,English,"No

108798,Does recession affect the monthly size and damage of horizontal fraud in the Netherlands?,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108798,"Fraud is a worldwide threat, and not surprisingly, also prevalent in the Netherlands. Earlier research showed that 9% of the Dutch population have been victimised by online scams or fraud. Some research has claimed that fraud levels are higher during recessions, since people face more pressure to commit fraud. However, no separate research was done about this relationship for the Netherlands. The research focuses only on horizontal fraud, directed at civilians and businesses. Fraud was measured in two ways: the monthly number of cases and the monthly monetary damage. The data is retrieved from the Fraudehelpdesk. The study is a time series study with a quantitative approach, about the period 2018-2024. Three indicators were used to determine whether a month was considered a recession: GDP, unemployment rates, and the inverted yield curve. This variable served as the basis to use in several regression analyses, with a GLS estimator, to provide the results. The results show that the relationship between recession and fraud is very minimal; out of four models, only in one model, with the shortest timeframe, and when other variables were added, recession was negatively significant to the number of fraud cases. The extent of cyber-dependency of the fraud and COVID-19 restrictions in a month also turned out not to be significant. From this research, it seems the effect of recession on horizontal fraud is very minimal, and more research, in other European countries or research on specific types of fraud, is needed to extend the knowledge of this relationship.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Fikkert, T.H.J.",September 2025,English,"No.

This study explored how embodied perspective-taking within a deforestation-themed workshop can cultivate ecological consciousness and influence perceptions of environmental awareness. Eight university students participated in a structured workshop that included sensory exploration, imaginative role-play of more-than-human beings, and collective dialogue inspired by the Council of All Beings. Data was gathered through reflective diaries and a one-month follow-up interview, then analysed using thematic analysis informed by Gallagher’s (2023) 4E framework of cognition (embodied, embedded, extended and enactive). Results indicate that ecological embodiment emerged in multifaceted ways. Sensory immersion deepened attentiveness to the forest, social dialogue fostered belonging and reflection, artefacts such as blindfolds and clay figurines scaffolded, but at the same time constrained imagination for some. Enactive role-play elicited emotions which ranged from empathy and hope to confusion and resistance. Collectively these findings suggest that ecological embodiment can strengthen affective connections with nature and perceived agency for environmental action, however, accessibility and depth varied among the participants. This study highlights the potential of embodied and imaginative methodology to complement traditional, information-centric sustainability education, while underscoring the need for future research on long-term effects and the integration of hybrid, multifaceted learning formats.Keywords: ecological consciousness, embodiment, deforestation, sustainability, pro-environmental behaviour",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Scanlon, D.M.",January 2025,English,"No.

108796,"Exploring Mindfulness as a Moderator for the Association between Cognitive Reappraisal, Rumination and Perceived Stress in Daily Life: An Experience Sampling Study",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108796,"Perceived stress, defined as the appraisal of situations as unpredictable, uncontrollable, or overwhelming, is a major risk factor for mental and physical health. Emotion regulation (ER) strategies play a central role in shaping these stress appraisals in daily life. Cognitive reappraisal (CR), an adaptive strategy of reinterpreting situations, has been linked to improved emotional outcomes, while rumination, a maladaptive focus on negative thoughts, is consistently associated with distress. However, evidence on their short-term effects on perceived stress in everyday contexts is inconsistent, and little is known about whether mindfulness may moderate these processes. To address this gap, the present study used an eight-day Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) design in which 53 young adults (aged 19–35) reported up to ten times daily on recent stressors, ER strategy use, and perceived stress. Linear mixed-effects models examined lagged associations between CR, rumination, and subsequent perceived stress, as well as moderation by trait mindfulness. Rumination predicted higher subsequent perceived stress (b= 0.40,p=.00). In contrast, CR was not significantly associated with perceived stress (b= -0.01,p= .93). Trait mindfulness moderated the rumination–stress association (b= -0.09,p= .01), individuals higher in mindfulness experienced weaker increases in stress following rumination. These findings highlight rumination as a process that maintains perceived stress in daily life, while mindfulness may buffer against its impact. In contrast, CR showed no reliable association, suggesting that its adaptiveness may be more context-dependent and harder to detect in naturalistic settings.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Jagosz, A.D.",September 2025,English,"No

This thesis investigates how digital health technologies can enhance the efficiency and quality of home care by exploring their impact on workforce challenges, patient self-management and care coordination. Through a qualitative research design, eight semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders in Dutch home care, including patients, district nurses and care organization representatives. Using thematic analysis in ATLAS.ti, data were coded and categorized around core themes: challenges in home-care services, benefits of technology integration, inter-organizational collaboration and necessary training and support activities. Findings show that technologies improve workflow efficiency, reduce the burden on caregivers and empower patients to manage routine aspects of their care. However successful implementation depends on adequate training for both caregivers and patients, as well as overcoming behavioral resistance and ensuring financial accessibility. The results emphasize the importance of flexibility and patient-centered design in digital solutions. The thesis proposes several practical recommendations, including mandatory technical training for caregivers and patients, improved collaboration between hospitals and home care organizations and policies advocating for better reimbursement structures.

The comparison is carried out using two CFD codes: the DLR TAU code and the SU2 code. Two transition models are considered—the γ–Reθ model by Langtry etal. and the one-equation model by Ströer—both coupled with the SST turbulence model. The one-equation model by Ströer has been newly implemented in SU2 and adopted in TAU. The study is conducted for the NLF(1)-0416, a standard two-dimensional airfoil test case at a Reynolds number of four million. By moving from best-practice to best-fit approaches, near perfect agreement could be demonstrated between the solvers, even for sensitive gradient quantities. It is shown that (i) upwind numerical flux schemes —particularly the L2 Roe solver— yield substantially higher inter-code agreement than standard central schemes, (ii) enabling rigorous cross-verification of the TAU and SU2 turbulence and transition models. In particular, the turbulence model settings strongly affect the predicted transition position and the transition region. The thesis investigates this effect with a focus on the stagnation point anomaly known for two equation turbulence models.

108787,Evaluation of the position and orientation  of the Gellhorn pessary and its influence  on pelvic organs in patients with pelvic  organ prolapse using upright MRI,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108787,"Introduction.Pessaries are often recommended as a conservative treatment option for women with symptomatic Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP). However, the overall success rate is limited, with only 63% of patients continuing pessary use after three months. Dislodgement is one of the main reasons for discontinuation.Switching from a ring pessary to a Gellhorn pessary may improve retention, but this type of pessary is also not always successful and carries a higher risk of complications. The aim of this study is to determine the in situ position of the Gellhorn pessary and its effect on pelvic organs, as a first step towards unraveling its support and working mechanism. Methods.Supine and upright magnetic resonance imaging was performed in six POP patients with a successful Gellhorn pessary ﬁt for more than three months. Scans were acquired before pessary insertion, immediately after insertion, and after one week of continuous use. Anatomical landmarks were placed to assess the position of the pelvic bony structures, the Gellhorn pessary, the lowest point of the bladder and uterus, the endometrial line, and the posterior bladder wall. Analyses included pessary position and orientation, shifts of the lowest points of bladder and uterus after pessary insertion, changes in uterus angle after pessary insertion, influence of the pessary on bladder shape, and 3D segmentationsof the pessary and surrounding pelvic organs to visualize spatial relationships. Results.Five patients were included in the final analysis. Upright imaging showed that pessaries shifted caudally (≥18 mm) and posteriorly compared to supine imaging, supporting the theory that the pubic bone does not contribute to pessary support. In the upright position, pessaries were tilted within the vaginal canal, with the stem directed anteriorly. Considerable variation between patients was found. The Gellhorn pessary effectively lifted the prolapsed bladder and uterus, and direct interaction of the pessary disc with the bladder was observed. Discussion and conclusion.More inclusions and analyses are needed to draw definitive conclusions regarding the support and working mechanisms of the Gellhorn pessary. Nonetheless, this study provided first insights into its anatomical position, orientation, and effects on pelvic organs.

Direct feedback is the feedback a student receives. Indirect feedback is defined as the inspiration of new understandings and confirmation of existing ones that reviewers gain from reviewing the work of peers, which can then be applied to their own work. Next to this, the relationship between reviewing performance and authoring performance was analysed, and whether components of a free-selection peer feedback format influence the reviewing scores of students. Free-selection indicated that students were able to choose which peer works to review and how many within a given range. The sample consisted of 61 participants, with the qualitative content analysis conducted on a sub-sample of 10 participants. The results showed that 56% of the revisions could be traced back to direct feedback. Which means that 44% could not be traced back to direct feedback and, thus, were likely to have another trigger. Of all the revisions, 4% could only be traced back to indirect feedback. This leaves 40% of the revisions without a clear trigger. However, because of the difficulty of tracing back indirect feedback, the percentage of revisions that are triggered by indirect feedback is likely larger. This could explain the part of the revisions that were not traced back to direct feedback. It was also found that getting direct and indirect feedback on the same topic might increase the urge to apply the feedback. Next to this, a positive relationship between the reviewing performance and authoring performance of students was found. To get more insight into the influence of components of free-selection on reviewing performance, this relationship was tested for the following components: the degree of the reviewed draft completion, the number of submitted reviews, the average perceived quality of reviewed peer works, the maximum perceived quality of the reviewed peer works, and the difference between the perceived qualities of the reviewed peer works.

The case study portrays that relational collaboration ambitions often exceed implementation in practice, especially in early partnership stages. The Gasunie partnership applies the most comprehensive approach; other cases show disparity between strategic intentions and partnership setup (e.g., insight governance structure and transformation management). Partnership barriers are: missing transformation management, absent or misaligned incentives, conflicting workload expectations, and an entrenched transactional culture. Identified enablers are fair workload allocation, clear performance metrics tied to incentives, and separation of management roles. The study extends bilateral-oriented theory to multilateral settings and introduces a new ailment: the illusion of perpetual demand. It points out that cultural alignment and trust are essential complements to formal governance for sustainable partnerships.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"Merkus, S.J.",September 2025,English,"No

108776,Pose estimation of MRI-compatible biopsy robot using fiducials and fiber optic stepper motor encoders,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108776,"The MAMRI, a six-degree-of-freedom, pneumatically actuated robotic arm, provides a MR-safe solution for performing breast cancer biopsies. However, it is reliant on feedforward control, which is susceptible to positioning errors from missed steps common in pneumatic actuation. This thesis details the development, integration, and validation of a hybrid feedback system designed to overcome this limitation and ensure accurate, reliable robot positioning for breast cancer biopsies. The developed solution consists of two complementary components. A software-based pose-estimation pipeline integrated into a custom 3D Slicer module automatically processes MRI scans to detect petroleum jelly-filled fiducial markers embedded within the MAMRI, solving the inverse kinematics to determine the robot’s initial configuration relative to the patient’s anatomy. This is extended through hardware-based, real-time feedback using custom MR-safe optical encoders integrated into each stepper motor. Using fiber optics to transmit signals, these encoders continuously track motor steps and direction without generating electromagnetic interference, enabling the system to detect and correct for missed steps or motor stalls. Validation of the pose-estimation pipeline demonstrated a mean accuracy of 6.9 steps or 0.74◦ in calculating the robot’s joint angles from MR-scan data. Experiments confirmed that the optical encoders provide reliable tracking during movements of multiple joints and successfully performed stall detection and position correction. The integration of these two systems successfully closes the control loop. These two systems are integrated into a complete biopsy control suite in 3D Slicer, allowing for collision-free trajectory planning and trajectory execution by the MAMRI remotely from the control room.

108775,"SPARK: Designing and Evaluating a Graph-RAG Multi-Agent System for Knowledge Capture, and Knowledge Access in a Support Ticket System",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108775,"Cape Service Point (CSP) is CAPE’s internally developed support ticket system used to manage customer issues and service requests. Compared to commercial IT Service Management (ITSM) tools, CSP offers few automation features, leaving many workflows dependent on manual input. This reduces efficiency and limits consistent service delivery. This research investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate and optimise support ticket workflows. We compare CSP with the state of the art through a structured literature review of academic work and a market analysis of ITSM platforms, and then model CSP’s current process and application landscape. The analysis finds two main issues: limited knowledge capture and limited access to this knowledge during ticket handling. By comparing academic and market perspectives, we also identify that academic research lags behind LLM features in ITSM platforms. To address these gaps, we design and evaluate SPARK (Service Point AI for Retrieval and Knowledge), a multi-agent system that combines LLMs with a knowledge graph (GraphRAG). Using iterative design cycles, we explore eight configurations varying in architecture, model, and memory. The final configuration achieves strong model-test results (F1=0.92, 0\% error) with a mean execution time of 39.7 seconds per question. SPARK was designed with responsible AI principles such as explainability and human oversight with human as a co-pilot design. We validate SPARK on five real-world use cases with CAPE employees. Across all cases, SPARK completes the assigned tasks successfully. Perceived explainability, clarity, and perceived correctness are consistently high. High-level queries, similarity search, and ticket summarisation are rated most useful, whereas ticket classification and the support assistant use-case score lower. Participants reported confirmation fatigue with the human-in-the-loop step, and Dutch and English prompts performed similarly. Overall, SPARK meets or partially meets the defined requirements and demonstrates meaningful automation for CSP. The thesis contributes a low-code GraphRAG reference implementation, a method for integrating vector search with graph reasoning, and a structured approach for designing and validating multi-agent systems. Validation was conducted on a restricted dataset and with a limited participant pool, constraining generalisability. Future work should extend the knowledge graph with real-time data, test additional use cases, and replicate results across organisations.",Master Business Information Technology (M-BIT),"de Boer, S.",September 2025,English,"No

108774,How does Citizen Participation manifest in the Metaverse: An Exploratory platform analysis of Virtual Worlds,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108774,"This thesis examines citizen participation in Metaverse platforms, specifically focusing on Virtual Reality. Participation models are used to analyize and categorize the participation happening within these VR Worlds. These models include Arnstein’s Ladder of Citizen Participation, Macintosh’s e-participation framework, and Terán & Drobnjak’s digital engagement model. A two-stage sequential methodical approach was used, combining systematic naturalistic observations in VRChat and Horizon Worlds, with semi-structured interviews involving experts on sociology and VR. The goal was to gain an understanding of the types of participation occurring in these platforms and to examine how they align with existing e-participation theory. Findings reveal clear differences between the platforms. VRChat, as a community-driven and highly open space, allows for a lot of personal expression and user-generated content. However, this openness also leads to disruptive behavior, hate speech, and scattered group dynamics, making deep and engaged participation difficult. Meanwhile, Horizon Worlds offers a more corporate, controlled, and branded environment. While it provides a safer and more regulated experience, especially for younger users, it lacks the freedom and opportunities for self-determination needed for digital citizen ownership to thrive on the platform. When assessed using the three participation models, both platforms mainly support lower levels of involvement, such as passive information sharing or limited consultation. Instances of active participation were rare or missing. Expert interviews also emphasized that for meaningful participation to happen, virtual spaces must facilitate goal-focused interaction, open dialogue, symbolic expression, and shared decision-making processes, elements that were mostly absent from both platforms. With these conclusions, this thesis takes an initial step toward discussing discourse on virtual citizenship within the context of the Metaverse.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"ten Vergert, T.J.H.",September 2025,English,"No.

Using a qualitative descriptive inquiry with evaluative elements, the research combined an actor analysis (Enserink et al., 2022), a SWOT procedure (Latysheva et al., 2017), and thematic analysis of interviews and documents. Thirteen actors were studied, including three municipal domains treated as a composite actor within a theoretical framework that integrates ecosystem theory and collaborative governance. The core finding is that Enschede’s bridging function between innovation-oriented Ecosystem A and knowledge- and delivery-oriented Ecosystem B is significant but underused. Moreover, actors are willing to collaborate, which supports near-term pilots with a path to long-term sustainability. The municipality should adopt an ecosystem-catalyst role, apply collaborative-governance principles, and translate broad ecosystem values and IZA, WOZO, and GALAinto SMART valuesto move from intent to measurable pilots and scale (Doran, 1981).This approach explicitly advances the triple-helix to a quadruple-helix,a model of collaboration between academia, industry, civil society and government, and operationalises it by structuring targeted co-creation to deliver regional societal outcomes in self-sufficient and healthy ageing. The municipality should cultivate the overarching Health and Med.Tech ecosystem into a coherent entrepreneurial Ecosystem At the interface of ecosystems A and B, with clear internal governance and external boundaries to enable tailored, co-created elderly-care solutions while mitigating structural barriers.

This study investigated the impact of the collaborative learningtechnique, the Jigsaw Method, on student wellbeing and social cohesion. This method wascompared to the Think-Pair-Share (TPS) Method. The study involved 57 comprehensiveschool children aged 11 to 14. Four classes were randomly assigned to either the Jigsaw orTPS method, resulting in two classes per condition, which were then organized into fiveJigsaw groups of five students each and 16 TPS pairs. Wellbeing and social cohesion weremeasured before and after the intervention using the KIDSCREEN-10 and GruKo4questionnaire. The results indicated no statistically significant differences in wellbeing andsocial cohesion between pre- and post-intervention measurements nor between the conditions.The results suggested that the one-time application of the intervention and the lack of teachingthe CL methods and accompanying communication skills might have limited theireffectiveness.

108767,From intention to implementation; bridging the gap in sustainable design,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108767,"The objectives of this research were; creating a design intervention which can help designers implement sustainability in their design process, creating an understanding of how designers can approach the topic of sustainability and what sustainability means. Assessing how tools for sustainability are used and how they are impacted by the (mis)use of terminology. And lastly finding out the effect of strategies in design and how they can effect the implementation of sustainability.To start the research a value proposition was written. Right now we are facing the challenges of climate change (Climate Change Impacts, Risks and Adaptation, 2025). The industry of design contributes to climate change as well, The current design of products still lead to a lot of pollution, emissions and material depletion (Ivanova et al., 2016). The value that this thesis aims to bring is support for designers in their efforts with sustainable design. It is too ambitious to say that this one thesis will have a notable impact on the design practice as a whole. But with this research I am to create a support for a specific group of designers/ companies who are trying to work in a more sustainable manner. During the research several factor were found that keep designers and companies from working sustainably even if this is what they want to do. By supporting people who want to do good.From the background research several inconsistencies were found related to sustainability. Firstly it became clear that the concept of sustainability is not clearly defined in literature (Glavič & Lukman, 2007; Ruggerio, 2021). Secondly, several interpretations of sustainability and design approaches to sustainability are questioned in their chances to reach sustainability (Ruggerio, 2021). Thirdly, in literature it was found that sustainability tools for designers often do not work, either by being too complicated(Vicente & Camocho, 2024a) or not meeting what is needed for actually improving design with regards to sustainability (Hassan, Mohd Fahrul et al., 2016). To approach the stated problems the research question was formulated as follows; What design intervention can help designers put sustainability at the basis of their design practice? This was answered through a series of central and sub question.Through this research a concept was developed to help both designers and design companies in their efforts to sustainable design. The concept is a workshop during which designers and management work together to create a strategy for improving the way they approach sustainable design. The workshop is based on the method of back casting. First a vision is created and that is used to create strategies that will help connect the current situation to the envisioned future. The concept is developed through a set-up, a definition of the goals, mock-ups of the materials that are used in the workshop and a set of questions that the participants will answer during the workshop to help guide the process.

108766,Improving the 3D scale model of a Treatment Center and transforming it into a serious game to aid the WHO builders in their training,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108766,"In collaboration with the World Health Organisation a project was conducted with the goal to improve the 3D scale model of a Treatment Center, and transform it into a serious game to aid the Treatment Center building team in their training on achieving a more effective facility layout and workflow optimization, focusing on the cases of the three infectious diseases Ebola, Cholera, and Covid-19. A Treatment Center can be described as a modular hospital, which is erected in the epidemic center of infectious diseases all over the world, with a specific focus on Africa for this project. Extensive research was conducted on Treatment Center preparation, building, and operation, the three discussed diseases, the fundamentals and application of serious gaming, and the current offering of the market in terms of similar projects, each of which were required to form an idea on how to approach the game design. The findings concerning the game design contained a few key factors. In order to be effective towards the learning goals, the game needed to contain real, practical information and knowledge, and simulate real situations as closely as possible. The principles of emotional engagement and flow impact perceived learning of serious games heavily, where the state of flow is a product from the right balance between the challenge offered by the game and the skill of the player. Lastly, in the consideration between a competitive and collaborative gameplay style, the latter was preferable in a context where encouraging teamwork and enhancing group problem-solving are the focus. As one of the main focusses for the game was for the players to understand how people and resources are moving in Treatment Centers, a versatile, acrylic game board was designed which can be drawn on with whiteboard markers. Other design choices for the physical attributes of the game, such as the 3D models, the playing cards, the manuals, and the box were based on accordance with African cultural believes, practicality and design theory based on experience and in relation to the other attributes, and the preferences of the client. The game was possible to be manufactured within budget due to the availability to execute most of it in-house at the University of Twente. After manufacturing was completed, the game was shipped to a representative of the WHO, who took it to a conference in Ghana, Africa in November 2024, where the game was first exhibited. Although the game meets all its requirements on paper, in theory is able to achieve the learning goals for its players, and left a very positive impression at the conference, its effectiveness in achieving its intended learning goals and true potential are not yet proven as the game has not yet been played by the intended target group. With great encouragement and urge, the WHO is requested to conduct testing and further research, in order to elevate the game to a higher level.

108763,The effectiveness of municipal climate adaptation policy instruments for households,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108763,"Dutch municipalities rely on households to achieve climate adaptation goals, as over half of urban land is privately owned. To encourage action, they apply a mix of policy instruments. Yet evidence on their effectiveness, especially in combination, is limited. This thesis examines how effective these instruments are for households, both individually and within policy mixes, through a comparative case study of six municipalities (Almelo, Enschede, Hardenberg, Hellendoorn, Winterswijk, and Zwolle). The analysis focuses on three commonly used instruments: the NK Tegelwippen campaign, subsidy schemes, and green coaches. Quantitative data (e.g. subsidy applications, number of removed tiles) and qualitative insights from interviews and policy documents were combined. Results show that targeted actions likeNK Tegelwippenare most effective, as they combine financial incentives, communication, and services to reach large groups quickly. Subsidy schemes, by contrast, depend strongly on households' initiative and achieve lower participation. green coaches currently reach few households but show potential when paired with targeted communication and modest incentives. The study concludes that effective municipal climate adaptation depends less on introducing new instruments and more on strategically combining existing ones. Coordinated policy mixes that lower barriers and address local challenges can significantly strengthen household participation.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"Evers, A.J.",September 2025,English,"No

108762,THE IDENTIFICATION OF INDICATORS FOR STAFF IMPACT CONSIDERATIONS IN EARLY HTA: A Consensus study using a Delphi approach,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108762,"Background:The capacity of the healthcare workforce has been under pressure. The use of health technologies can help reduce this burden as they enable more efficient care with limited resources. Identification of facilitators and barriers can allow for early adjustment during health technology development increasing the chance of successful implementation. This process runs parallel to early Health Technology Assessments (early HTA), which is used to assess the potential value of a new health technology by evaluating the expected costs and effects of the technology compared to current care[1,2]. Although important, labour impact is currently not taken into account in early HTA. Objective:This study aims to identify indicators to evaluate labour impact in early HTA. Method:An online e-Delphi was conducted, which is a method that focuses on achieving consensus among a panel of experts on a specific topic through multiple iterative anonymous rounds to collect and aggregate expert opinion[3]. The panel consisted of 10 HTA-experts, 8 innovation developers, and 10 healthcare workers. The first round (n=21) focused on idea generation through open ended questions to identify which aspects were deemed important to evaluate labour impact. The results were used to formulate indicators through thematic analysis. The second round (n=16) focused on rating the importance of these indicators through a 7-point Likert scale. The third round (n=19) focused on measuring consensus development and ranking of the most important indicators. In both round 2 and 3, the consensus criterion was defined as a Percentage Agreement of 75% (PA). Results:A total of 20 indicators were formulated relating the themes workload, work experience, effect of the innovation on the work of healthcare workers, the user experience, and time investment of the care process. Fourteen of these 20 indicators were deemed important. The most important indicator was the difference in the total time a patient needs to complete the care pathway with or without the use of the innovation. Conclusion:This study provides 14 potential indicators to evaluate the labour impact in early HTA. The difference in time a patient spends on completing the care pathway was deemed the most important. Despite limitations, findings give insight into objective and subjective indicators that can provide a way to estimate viability of and possibly adjust health technology in early HTA.

This imbalance threatens to create severe nurse shortages,which further threatens reduced quality and efficiency of care. Increasing the number of heart failurepatients transitioning to home-based care was raised as a potential solution, but identifying eligiblepatients remains complex due to fragmented data.A model was constructed that simulates average absolute bed occupancy data as input and applies anoptimization technique called Integer Linear Programming to solve the nurse allocation problem. Themodel effectively captures the effects of patient demand increases, reductions in staffing levels,increased utilization of the Luscii app, and the transition to home-based care on meeting demand. Themodel results show that if demand increases and available nurse capacity declines, unmet demandbegins appearing within the first year and progressively worsens as shown in Figure 1. The main driverof this unmet demand is the projected 20% FTE decline over five years. While patient demandfluctuations contribute to workforce strain, the steady decline in available nurses presents the greatestlong-term risk.Expansion of care transition to home settings is an effective way to alleviate unmet demand. A 10%shift in care to home settings delays the onset of unmet demand by a year and reduces its severity.However, as FTE levels continue to drop, the benefits of care transition become less.For long-term stability, further integration of medium care nurses into transitional care could offer amore structured and sustainable solution to managing the growing patient demand.

108752,Merging Complex Cyber Security Maturity Models into a Simple Quick Test: A Methodology based on Industry Expert Evaluation,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108752,"This increase has prompted the development of models and tools to evaluate the state of cyber security in companies, otherwise known as the \textit{maturity}. One of the main models used to assess the cyber security maturity is the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). In literature, we see this model evolve, starting from the very first of its kind in 1993. In the past 30 years, this evolution has resulted in over 25 different cyber security variations of the original CMM. These different variations all try to bridge a gap in the structure of a previous model. However, we see little of these developments reflected in the cyber security industry. This indicates that the discrepancy between academic models and the industry does not originate from the specific content of the models, but rather orginates from the difficult process of adopting these complex models. To bridge this gap, we propose a method that takes into account several models and the current way-of-working of the industry, and simplifies them into a simple test. Our method, build over 3 design iterations focused on content, usability and value as perceived by an end-user, has been evaluated at each step by consultants and companies to facilitate the improvement of the next iteration. With as a final result: a simple test made up out of 21 multiple choice questions that can be completed within 30 minutes and quantifies the overall security maturity of a company. The evaluations reveal a high perceived usefulness and perceived ease-of-use by consultants and companies alike, indicating our method as a valuable contribution to bridge the gap between academic maturity models and the use of maturity models in the industry.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Maas, R.F.",September 2025,English,"No.

108751,Political Influencers? How German Parties Win Over Young Voters On TikTok,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108751,"Objective:TikTok has become a central arena for political communication in Germany, especially for reaching young voters during election campaigns. While parties like the AfD and Die Linke have effectively used platform-native styles, little is known about how such strategies resonate with young audiences. This study examines how rhetorical techniques, visual elements, and politainment shaped the appeal of German parties’ TikTok content during the 2025 federal election campaign. Methods:Five focus groups with 25 young voters aged 19 to 27 viewed TikTok videos from major German parties (SPD, CDU, Grünen, Linke, AfD) and discussed their interpretations, emotional reactions, and judgments. The data were analyzed using thematic coding. Results:Three factors shaped the appeal of political TikToks: platform fit, emotional tone and relatability, and speaker persona. Trend-driven videos were more engaging, while formal formats were dismissed as boring. Positive, authentic emotional tones fostered connection, whereas fear-driven content often elicited skepticism. Authentic and relatable politicians enhanced credibility, while contradictions in the persona or poor platform fit undermined trust. Conclusion:Political TikToks resonate when stylistic fluency is paired with authentic messaging, constructive emotions, and credible personas. Politainment can capture attention, but effectiveness depends on balancing entertainment with substance. Resonance is less about spectacle and more about authenticity, offering both theoretical insights into platform-driven campaigning and practical guidance for parties looking to engage Gen Z.

108749,“What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Stronger.”_ A Dictionary Creation Experiment on the Positive Psychological Concept of Resilience,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108749,"In thisthesis a dictionary for the emerging concept of ‘resilience’ in the field of Positive Psychology was developed. Currently, no such dictionary exists, and its creation would benefit text-mining research and practitioners. The dictionary method was guided by the LIWC approach, and its steps were closely followed. However, due to the concept’s complexity and rarity in language, a novel validation strategy was employed. Face validity was first established by the author and other researchers. Three distinct corpora were then constructed, one with language representing resilience, one with moderate resilience language, and one with low resilience language, to test content validity. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha and the Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20). The results support content validity, showing highest activation in the high-resilience corpus, moderate activation in the moderate-resilience corpus, and lowest activation in the randomized corpus. Furthermore, Cronbach’s alpha (0.56) falls within the acceptable range for language research, and KR-20 (0.85) is strong, supporting the dictionary’s reliability. The findings provide a solid foundation for the further development of the dictionary’s validity and reliability. However, future research should strengthen its validity by testing it against related concepts and expanding the corpora used. It is discussed that, despite the dictionary being valid and reliable, its performance may depend on context and corpus design. Lastly, the study highlights the complexity of linguistic research and the importance of contextual awareness and human oversight when computerizing the process.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Düwel, M.K.",September 2025,English,"No

108747,Autonomous Exploration And 3D Reconstruction Using Collaborative Drones,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108747,"The use of aerial robotics in the domain of civil engineering and infrastructure assessment has unlocked a very powerful domain in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction Industry. As these infrastructures start to age, their structural integrity starts to deteriorate. Traditionally, the inspection of infrastructures is carried out manually, which can take days for normal infrastructures like a bridge and weeks for larger infrastructures like high-voltage powerlines. These applications demand methods that are scalable, rapid, and cost-effective solutions that can automate this process by understanding the information available in the scene. The cost effectiveness factor is defined to be the type of sensor and the expense of operation of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based inspection task. In comparison, LiDAR and depth sensors are readily available but have operational complexities like the payload and cost of the sensor. Current levels of autonomy involve complete control over the dynamics of an infrastructure inspection mission. Another implication is that traditional path planning methods require detailed information and insights of the infrastructure to be inspected. In time critical tasks like disaster response, such requirements can be problematic as the requirement of a predefined model is not guaranteed. This research provides a solution to these problems by autonomously exploring a large 3D infrastructure object using UAVs equipped with an RGB Sensor. The autonomous exploration task is labelled as the Next Best View (NBV) problem. The autonomous exploration workflow estimates the NBVs required to cover an infrastructure object. A state-of-the-art NBV called MACARONS is selected in this research. The MACARONS-NBV is a self-supervised NBV prediction method that uses a monocular RGB camera to establish a 3D occupancy of an environment with infrastructure objects. The MACARONS-NBV architecture is designed in such a way to select a set of candidate camera views (NBVs) that maximize the surface coverage of an object. This trajectory is then assigned to a collaborative system of UAVs that coordinate with one another in a centralized communication channel to optimize their trajectories and avoid obstacles if encountered. The goal of the collaborative multi-UAV is to collect the infrastructure image data in an optimized manner. We utilize a set of methodologies to dynamically assign the workload of a UAV with awareness of their surroundings and any other UAV agents. The outcome of this is a network of UAVs that can simultaneously collect data for a large infrastructure object and can balance one another’s workload depending on the remaining energy level. We then use an offline image-based 3D Reconstruction workflow of the infrastructure object and assess the completion of the object using Cloud-to-mesh (C2M) and Cloud-to-Cloud (C2C) distances. We were able to optimize the path of UAVs to efficiently traverse large scenes as well as demonstrate dynamic Task Reassignment for the collaborative aspect of UAVs. Additionally, we also conduct a detailed comparison of an autonomous UAV mission using LiDAR-based inspection compared to a monocular RGB-based with reference to the ground truth.",Master Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (M-GEO-WO),"Hanif, M.A.",July 2025,English,"Yes

The two modalities may need to be synchronized if they are captured separately, or if a delay arises from hardware or software limitations. This research analyzes the feasibility of using Temporal Cycle-Consistency (TCC) learning for achieving automated audio-visual synchronization. TCC is a self-supervised learning technique for learning temporal correspondences between two sequences, by enforcing cycle-consistent nearest-neighbor mappings. In our approach, we use contrastively trained encoders to map audio and video tracks to a shared latent embedding space. We then use temporally cycle-consistent embeddings to align the audio and video embeddings, and reconstruct audio spectrograms using a decoder. By measuring the performance of different variations in this architecture, we analyze the impact of incorporating TCC as a training objective.

The assignment is conducted abroad, in the Systemair Bulgaria branch, where the awareness of the full product range is not as well developed as in other locations of the company. The goal of the project is to create an attractive marketing presentation tool for displaying products and promoting brand awareness while increasing visitors’ engagement during conventions, specifically adapted to the Bulgarian current market.This report itself is divided into five phases that follow the structure of a Double Diamond design process that ensures a structured and user-centered approach through the four main stages: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver. Each phase has a main research question accompanied by sub-questions. This division is in order to bring the project as close as possible to the aim:“This assignment aims to design an interactive and modular product display stand that captures Systemair’s brand identity (visually and functionally). It will be used as an effective marketing tool in exhibitions and presentations to clearly represent Systemair’s offerings and increase customer/user engagement.”By following this design structure, multiple research methods were used.The starting point was a literature review, exploring booth and product stand design, with emphasis on brand perception, user engagement, and strategies to improve these elements in the design. This helped for a better understanding of how physical features and experiential elements affect brand perception.Moreover, a general company analysis was done to ensure the brand's true product, along with market research focusing on the Bulgarian macroenvironment. This includes the main values, mission, and vision of Systemair. This is followed by analysis of the competitive environment, which assisted with pinpointing strengths and weaknesses of the way Systemair presents itself in the Bulgarian market, providing clear overview of how the brand can be differentiated fromits competitors.In addition to that, of a big significance was to identifying the specific users and their needs during conventions. This would ensure the correct elements to incorporate in the final design of the product stand.By applying the research insights, four concepts were created and evaluated. One of them stood out and was developed further, which resulted in a modular, freestanding product stand. It is presented as a structure with rotating cubes, a digital screen, catalogue storage space and a sample product space that are in alignment with the main client demands. Additionally, there are a few zones of interaction that align well with the conducted literature review making the product more attractive and engaging for the visitors.As a conclusion from the process, the creation of a tangible marketing tool that represents the company, answers the target audience's needs, and is a satisfactory result for Systemair Bulgaria was successfully completed.

This study explores the learning potential of peer feedback in lower secondary mathematics education (VMBO-TL students, aged 12-14 years), a field that is currently underexplored. Particular attention is given to the effect of additional self-regulation feedback prompts in addition to feedback prompts at the task, process, and self level. In addition, the study examines students’ peer feedback quality over time, the role of gender on peer feedback quality, and the relationship between prior mathematics achievement, peer feedback quality and future mathematics achievement. A quasi-experimental research design was adopted and mixed methods were used to investigate the topic. After a brief training session, students provided peer feedback on eight occasions over a three-week intervention using either a short or long peer feedback template. In comparison to the short template, the long template contained additional self-regulation peer feedback prompts. Results revealed no significant effect of peer feedback or template version on a subsequent mathematics test. However, students who participated in the intervention scored on average almost a full grade point higher on this test. Surprisingly, peer feedback quality declined over time for all students, particularly for students using the longer template. Female students produced significantly higher-quality peer feedback than male students, and prior mathematics achievement was positively correlated with future mathematical achievement. The findings suggest that peer feedback can be effectively implemented in secondary mathematics education, provided that peer feedback activities are carefully scaffolded and tailored to students’ needs. Future research should aim to replicate this study on a larger scale and over a longer period.

Three scheduling strategies, namely First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Nearest-Task-First (NTF), and Farthest-Task-First (FTF), were implemented and evaluated using 50 days of real operational data. The results demonstrate that the Nearest-Task-First (NTF) strategy consistently outperforms the other approaches by reducing task completion times and minimizing travel distance.

This thesis develops a two-stage, explainable machine-learning approach to diagnose and reduce losses using eleven weeks of Warehouse Management System data. A Global-Effects Model (GEM) explains hourly throughput per depalletiser; a Local-Effects Model (LEM) predicts depalletisation time per collo. XGBoost and MLP models are interpreted with SHAP and mapped to an extended 4M framework. The GEM (XGBoost) achieves R²=0.858, the LEM achieves R²=0.760. Three drivers dominate hourly throughput: average depalletisation duration per collo, ‘no pallet in DEP’ (supply starvation), and ‘jam’ (take-away interruptions). Material features explain most variation. Quantified levers show the potential of stabilising inflow and reducing jams: fully preventing ‘no pallet in DEP’ would yield about 4.41% production (time) increase; eliminating jams would add 7.71%. Quick wins can be realised by using two created product rankings that guide relocation of suited products into the automated flow and unsuited products towards manual flows. Revising product allocation would increase throughput by 1.7%. Together these measures approximate 13% expected throughput increase, closing most of the observed gap, although system interdependencies, supply chain constraints and ever-changing circumstances highlight the need for further model development towards an 'overall-best' system design.

108731,Evaluating Citizenship Education in Dutch Primary Schools: A Comparative Study of Traditional Innovative and Regular Educational Models,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108731,"Citizenship education aims to equip students with the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes necessary for active participation in democratic society. In the Netherlands this has been a legal requirement for schools since 2006, with stricter criteria introduced in 2021. Despite these mandates, implementation remains inconsistent, and recent evaluations by the Dutch Inspectorate of Education have identified widespread deficiencies. This study investigates how traditional innovative primary schools, Montessori, Dalton, and Jenaplan, compare to regular schools in their implementation of citizenship education, as assessed through inspection reports. Comparing these school types is particularly relevant because traditional innovative schools embody distinct pedagogical visions that emphasize autonomy, collaboration, and critical-democratic engagement, which may shape how citizenship education is interpreted and enacted. Drawing on a layered theoretical framework incorporating national policy, school-level pedagogical vision, and student outcomes, the study examines 304 inspection reports published between August 2023 and June 2024. Using content analysis, five core aspects of citizenship education were coded as strongly addressed, critically mentioned, or not mentioned. In addition, the presence of recovery assignments, formal interventions issued by the Inspectorate, was analyzed in relation to these aspects. Contrary to expectations, no statistically significant differences were found between regular and traditional innovative schools across the five citizenship education aspects. However, Montessori schools were significantly less likely to receive recovery assignments. Moreover, reports with multiple critically mentioned aspects were strongly associated with the issuance of recovery assignments, particularly when stimulating active citizenship was identified as deficient. The findings challenge the assumption that innovative pedagogical models inherently yield better citizenship education outcomes and raise concerns about the consistency and transparency of the Inspectorate’s evaluative criteria. The study concludes that evaluation frameworks may privilege measurable compliance over pedagogical richness, potentially overlooking context-specific approaches to citizenship education. Recommendations are made for more nuanced, standardized, and pedagogically sensitive inspection practices.",Master Educational Science and Technology (M-EST),"Overwater, K.",September 2025,English,"No

While innovation culture is widely considered an antecedent of innovation,prior research has often treated it as a monolithic construct, neglecting the nuanced role of thedistinct dimensions, which is critical in the unique challenges that process innovation brings.This thesis addresses this gap by disaggregating innovation culture into four actionabledimensions: digital openness, learning orientation, risk-taking, and collaboration, andexamining their influence on process innovation in manufacturing firms. Additionally,environmental and technological complexity (ETC) is introduced as a moderator to researchwhether this strengthens, weakens, or reverses the effects.Building on the Knowledge-Based View (KBV) and Organizational Learning Theory (OLT),this thesis develops a theoretical framework to explain how cultural dimensions drive processinnovation while being influenced by ETC. A quantitative research design was used, employinga stratified sampling approach to gather professionals from manufacturing sectors such assemiconductor, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and automotive. This resulted in collected datafrom 98 professionals through an online survey. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) andreliability testing were used to confirm the construct structure, followed by multiple regressionand moderation analysis to test the hypotheses.The results reveal that collaboration is the strongest and only significant predictor of processinnovation. Moderation analysis reveals that ETC significantly reduces digital openness andrisk-taking, while learning orientation reduces slightly, and collaboration remains stable acrossenvironments. These findings suggest that an innovation culture is not uniformly beneficial;under high environmental and technological complexity, certain cultural dimensions fail todrive, and even hinder process innovation.Theoretically, this research contributes by disaggregating innovation culture into actionabledimensions, integrating KBV and OLT into a unified framework, and introducing ETC as amoderator. Practically, the results provide actionable insights for managers to prioritize specificcultural dimensions depending on the ETC.

108728,Pleasant Scents as Modulators of Stress During a Crowded Bus Ride: Evidence from an EEG study,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108728,"Although olfactory cues are known to influence stress and comfort, research has largely neglected their role in crowded public transport settings. Currently, no studies have examined how scent and crowding interact with each other using continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) in semi-naturalistic contexts. This thesis addresses this gap by investigating whether ambient scents can buffer stress responses during stimulated bus commuting. Using a 32-channel EEG system, we measured stress-related theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) activity during a 40-minute simulated bus ride under crowded and uncrowded conditions. Participants were intermittently exposed to pleasant scents (vanilla blossom, blue orchid). EEG data were segmented into short ‘scent’ intervals (30-s periods during fragrance release) and matched ‘no-scent’ intervals immediately preceding release, allowing for a comparison of neural activity under both conditions. The data were pre-processed and segmented into no-scent and scent conditions. To measure the effects on stress, specifically theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) band frequencies were analysed for changes across the different bus and scent conditions using power spectral density analysis. To complement the EEG, a questionnaire was employed to collect subjective reports of stress and mood before, during the change of video and after. Overall, the results indicated that brief exposure to pleasant scents was associated with a small, spatially diffuse reduction in theta-band activity, which may indicate a modest lowering of cognitive and emotional load in this simulated commuting context. However, these effects were subtle, non-regional, and variable across individuals. Future studies with larger samples, automated scent delivery, and multimodal stress measures (e.g., including heart‐rate variability) are needed to clarify the robustness and practical relevance of olfactory interventions in real‐world settings.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Christofides, P.",September 2025,English,"No

The current sequencing method results in an inefficient sequence of operations, primarily due to excessive travel and tool switching times. The problem is modelled as a variant of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) combined with aspects of the Travelling Cutting-tool Problem (TCP). A mathematical model is formulated to capture the objective of minimising the combined travel and tool switching time. Several advanced metaheuristic solution methods were developed and tested, including Simulated Annealing (SA), Strategic Oscillating SA (SOSA), Variable Neighbourhood SA (VNSA), and Strategic Oscillating VNSA (SO-VNSA). Experiments on real-life production data demonstrated that the improved sequencing methods significantly reduce completion times, with the best-performing method (SO-VNSA) achieving up to 47.40% improvement compared to the original constructive approach.

These dynamic models learn continuously to adapt to new concepts, as previous ones become invalid, but their performance is often limited by throughput. The Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) is a state-of-the-art model for this setting, which naturally exposes parallelism and is therefore well-suited for hardware acceleration. However, prior Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based accelerators are vendor-locked and rely on resource-hungry Floating-Point (FP) arithmetics, limiting their scalability and portability. We present OpenWoud a vendor-unlocked ARF framework for FPGAs. Our designreplaces FP operators with a flexible Fixed-Point (FxP) arithmetic library and introduces fully transparent, manually scheduled dataflows for training and drift detection. Enabling fine-grained time/area trade-offs and predictable behavior across platforms. Comprehensive evaluation on both synthetic and real datasets shows that OpenWoud maintains or increases accuracy (up to +12.89%), compared to a prior FPGA accelerator, while reducing the resource utilization by half. Competitive performance is observed compared to GPU (0.5 - 1.5× speed-up) and FPGA baseline (0.2 - 0.5×), despite the latter being based on idealized simulation.

108723,From Capturing Attention to Building Equity: Predicting the Effectiveness of Chocomel’s Social Media Advertising,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108723,"Introduction:In today’s digital landscape, brands like Chocomel rely on social media advertising to gain consumer attention and strengthen brand equity. This study investigates how the ad characteristics: brand elements and design complexity, affect ad engagement and brand equity outcomes. Additionally, the moderating roles of generation (Gen Z vs. Gen Y) is examined in shaping brand equity. Objectives:This thesis investigates how brand elements and design complexity affect brand equity (brand awareness and brand associations), and whether these effects differ between Gen Z and Gen Y. It also examines how brand elements influence ad engagement (reach and impressions) in real-world social media advertising. By combining consumer-based insights with performance data, the research bridges the gap between individual-level perceptions and platform-level outcomes. Literature review:While existing advertising models emphasize informativeness and entertainment, less is known about how visual characteristics such as brand elements and design complexity influence ad effectiveness in rapid-scrolling platforms. Prior findings suggest mixed outcomes, with strong branding sometimes triggering resistance and subtle branding enhancing engagement. Meanwhile, minimalism supports clarity, but visual richness attracts attention. Most research isolates either individual-level brand equity or platform-level performance. This thesis combines both to provide a more integrated view. Methods:This thesis uses two complementary studies: an experiment testing effects on brand equity and an ad performance analysis of real-world advertisements, together providing individual-level and platform-level insights. Study 1 employed a between-subjects experiment (N = 145) to test how brand elements and design complexity affect brand awareness and brand associations across generations. Study 2 analyzed 60 historical Meta advertisements from Chocomel, examining how brand elements influenced reach and impressions on Instagram and Facebook. Conclusion:Strong brand elements enhanced brand equity in Study 1, while design complexity showed no main effect. Gen Z preferred minimalist ads over Gen Y, pointing to generational differences. In Study 2, brand elements did not significantly affect reach or impressions, though trends suggested slightly higher impressions with stronger brand elements. These findings highlight that strong brand elements in advertisements are central to building equity. For theory, this suggests that brand equity and platform-level ad performance should be treated as complementary but distinct success dimensions. For practice, it suggests that marketers should prioritise recognisable branding cues in FMCG contexts, while treating design complexity with caution, as its contribution to equity appears limited.

108722,Residual strength of dikes after macro-instability: A First-Order Reliability Method framework for follow-up failure mechanisms,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108722,"In civil engineering, a clear definition of acceptable risk is crucial for designing and assessing infrastructures, such as primary flood defenses. This research is motivated by the shift in flood protection policy in the Netherlands, in which the focus was shifted to flood risk-based assessment and design of primary flood defenses. Since the implementation of this policy, there has been a deeper emphasis on the analysis of comprehensive failure paths that lead to flooding and probabilistic techniques. Instead of evaluating the failure state, which is usually the occurrence of a failure mechanism, the flooding state should be considered. Considering comprehensive failure paths up until the point of actual flooding helps to estimate more accurately the safety of primary flood defenses since it accounts for the residual strength. Especially in the case of macro-instability, often residual strength is overlooked because assessment and design is focused on geotechnical failure. This thesis aims to develop a methodology to quantify the probability of flooding from failure paths initiated by macro-instability in a probabilistic manner. The approach explicitly incorporates residual strength and interactions among multiple failure mechanisms. The foundation of the methodology is established through a constructed event tree based on existing literature. The follow-up mechanisms considered in this study include a secondary macro-instability, internal sand erosion, and erosion of the residual profile due to overtopping waves. A total of eight individual failure paths were identified, driven by two main hydraulic loadings: the water level and wave overtopping. Separate limit state models were developed to determine the probability of failure for each individual mechanism probabilistically. This probability was approximated using the First-Order Reliability Method (FORM). Subsequently, a probabilistic framework was established to derive the total failure probability for the identified failure paths. This framework also includes the connection between the individual mechanisms. To demonstrate the practical application of this methodology, a case study was conducted on a dike cross-section with a sand core and clay cover, which was adapted to facilitate the methodology and divided into two variants: a wide dike and a narrow dike. The results of the case study showed the functionality of the developed models and framework, revealing that the total probability of failure for the identified paths could be effectively determined. By comparing the total failure probability of the failure paths including a follow-up mechanism with the total failure probability of only the initial macro-instability, an indication of the residual strength was made. The results showed that erosion due to overtopping waves is the normative follow-up mechanisms. It was shown that overtopping quickly leads to large erosion of the residual profile, however likelihood of the hydraulic conditions necessary for failure are small. As for the other to follow-up mechanisms, the reduction of the total failure probability was more significant. In addition, for these two mechanisms the (residual) strength of the dike was largely governed by the width of the dike and geometry of the initial slip circle. The limit state models and corresponding framework are currently limited to the upper river area of the Netherlands due to the assumption of independence between water levels, wind directions and wind speeds. It is suggested to study the dependence of these hydraulic boundary conditions to increase the applicability of the framework to more water systems. In addition, the normative slip circle of the initial macro-instability was used. However, the results of the internal sand erosion mechanism showed that the normative slip circle does not necessarily lead to the normative failure path. Therefore, it is recommended to extend the method in such a manner that multiple slip circles can systematically be investigated. Ultimately, this study aims to enhance the precision of flood risk evaluations, reduce conservatism in design, and contribute to the overall safety and reliability of Dutch flood defenses. Therefore, as this study has indicated, design practices should consider residual strength by analyzing comprehensive failure paths.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"olde Heuvel, E.M.",September 2025,English,"No

108720,Internet-Based Positive Psychology Interventions in Clinical Populations: A Systematic Review,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108720,"A large majority of the suffering individuals do not achieve good well-being, which is essential for positive mental health, and can support the treatment of mental disorders. Positive psychology interventions (PPIs) were developed to enhance well-being in any individual. PPIs are well suited for internet delivery, with the added potential of reaching more individuals than traditional therapy. This review provides an overview of internet-based PPIs in clinical populations, focusing mainly on their efficacy. It also examines intervention designs, theoretical backgrounds, mechanisms, levels of guidance, and dropout rates. A literature search in Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO identified 3,785 articles. After duplicate removal and abstract screening using ASReview, a machine learning software, a total of 151 articles were screened in full text, based on set inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible studies had to be internet-based PPIs (including mobile apps) for clinical populations (with at least elevated symptom levels), assess well-being or clinical symptoms, and not be solely focused on mindfulness. Nine articles met the selection criteria. All nine studies were RCTs and focused on individuals with chronic pain, depression, mixed anxiety and depression and substance abuse. They suggest that PPIs relative to their control condition significantly improve well-being (or its sub-dimensions such as happiness) and, to a lesser extent, reduce clinical symptoms. Additionally, the studies used varying levels of guidance and had a weighted dropout rate of 35.8% in the PPI groups. Lastly, the studies were mostly multicomponent PPIs that were theoretically based on the broaden-and-build theory, with two multicomponent studies not providing a theoretical background. Furthermore, the mechanisms through which internet-based PPIs enhance well-being in clinical populations were not part of the aims and not studied in the included papers. In conclusion, internet-based PPIs seem effective at enhancing well-being in clinical populations and to a lesser degree at reducing clinical symptoms. The studies are comparable to the wider field of offline PPIs, where the overall effectiveness is comparable. While most studies were multicomponent, it remains uncertain whether they perform better than monocomponent PPIs. More research on the designs and mechanisms is needed to draw any conclusions. Lastly, the findings support that self-guided interventions show higher study dropout rates than human-guided PPIs.

Spatiotemporal dispersion (STD) patterns in intracardiac electrograms (EGM) show promise for identifying these drivers, yet current visual identification is subjective and inconsistent. This study aims to develop and evaluate a deep learning model that standardizes STD identification while accounting for inter-individual variability in atrial condition, enabling more personalized ablation strategies. Methods:This retrospective, single-centre study included patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF who underwent STD ablation at Isala Hospital. Electroanatomical maps with labelled intracardiac EGMs were collected, and 18 electrophysiological features were extracted per EGM. Inter-individual variability in EGM characteristics was assessed both visually and statistically using non-parametric tests. Alarge-scale biomedical geometric algebra transformer (LAB-GATr) was trained on 115 left atrium maps, integrating spatial geometry and EGM features for STD classification. Model performance was evaluated using stratified five-fold cross-validation and 20 independent test maps. Six additional maps from unsuccessful ablation cases were used for post hoc evaluation. Probabilistic outputs were interpolated into STD probability maps and compared with ablation targets in both successful and unsuccessful ablation cohorts. Results:Variability analysis confirmed significant inter-individual differences in EGM characteristics (p< 0.01), with STD signals showing shorter, more irregular intervals, reduced waveform similarity, and higher fractionation than non-STD signals. The LaB-GATr model achieved robust performance, with cross-validated accuracy of 0.94 and F1 score of 0.53 and maintained consistent results on the independent test set (accuracy 0.96, F1 score 0.57). Combining spatial geometry with electrophysiological features outperformed either alone. Probability maps closely aligned with ablation targets in the successful cohort, while in the unsuccessful cohort, larger high-probability regions remained untreated. Conclusions:Atrial remodelling in AF is patient-specific, limiting the utility of STD identification based on fixed thresholds and single EGMs. By integrating geometry and electrophysiological features, the LaB-GATr model generated accurate STD probability maps that reflected the most diseased STD patterns and corresponded with ablation outcomes. These findings support LaB-GATr as a decision-support tool, capable of guiding electrophysiologists toward the most clinically relevant STD regions and supporting more standardized and personalized ablation strategies.

108709,Effects of state representation on the cooperation between reinforcement learning agents.,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108709,"Understanding the conditions that foster cooperation among self-interested agents has critical implications for addressing collective challenges such as climate change mitigation, resource allocation, and anti-competitive behavior. This thesis investigates how different state space representations (which are representations of the agents' one-step histories) influence emergence of cooperative behavior in reinforcement learning agents operating within the iterated prisoner's dilemma framework. We examine four distinct state representations designed to encourage the learning of specific strategies: Win-Stay, Lose-Shift (WSLS), which repeats the action if the previous round outcome was favorable; Grim-Trigger (GT), which cooperates if both players cooperated in the last round, and defects if either player defected; Tit-for-Tat (TfT), which mirrors the opponent's previous action; and Repeat (RT), which mirrors the agent's own previous action.Through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments using both Q-learning and Decentralized Q-learning algorithms, we demonstrate that state space representation significantly affects both the likelihood of cooperation and the speed of learning. Our results show that the WSLS and GT state spaces substantially improve cooperation rates and reduce learning time in Q-learning, particularly for high reward-to-punishment ratios, though they can lead agents to learn non equilibrium strategy profiles, such as All-C. For Decentralized Q-learning, the WSLS state space achieves the highest cooperation rates, though cooperative strategies emerge upto only 50% of learning trajectories. Notably, TfT consistently fails to sustain cooperation across both algorithms, while Repeat shows limited cooperation only within a narrow parameter range in Q-learning but no cooperation in Decentralized Q-learning. Both of these state spaces only incorporate information of one agent's action. In contrast, the WSLS and GT state spaces, which incorporate information about both agents' actions, demonstrate significantly better and more robust cooperative performance across a broader range of conditions.",Master Applied Mathematics (M-AM),"Mainkar, V.R.",September 2025,English,"No

108708,Exploring the Role of Beavers in Enhancing River Resilience,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108708,"Beavers (Castor fiber) are increasingly recognised as ecosystem engineers that are capable of enhancing hydrological river resilience through dam building, thereby also exerting an influence on anthropogenic environments. Due to the controversy surrounding beavers in the Netherlands, this research explores the hydrological and socioeconomic impacts of beaver activities in four European countries: the Netherlands, England, Scotland, and Germany. The objective of this research is to provide insights to enhance the resilience of Dutch socioecological river systems and inform the development of Dutch adaptive beaver management strategies. The research develops Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and evaluates the potential role of beavers as a Nature-based Solution (NbS) within Dutch socioecological river systems. An initial literature review was conducted to identify existing knowledge on impacts and knowledge gaps on hydrological and socioeconomic beaver impacts. These results are compared with results from semi-structured expert interviews, providing practical insights into hydrological processes, land use conflicts, beaver management strategies, and stakeholder perceptions across the four countries. Literature and experts agree that beaver dams contribute to flood attenuation of smaller floods, drought resilience, and enhanced water storage, especially when dams are present in sequence. However, uncertainties remain around the effectiveness of beaver dams in mitigating large flood events and the conditions leading to dam failure. While agricultural sectors and infrastructure, including Dutch flood defences, face challenges from inundation and burrowing, water retention and ecotourism are promising. Stakeholder perceptions differ across countries and are shaped by local policies, the level of stakeholder engagement, spatial characteristics, and prior experiences with beavers. Dutch stakeholders, particularly in flood safety, perceive the compromised flood safety as the most important impact originating from beavers, revealing the need for proactive management strategies. Illegal reintroductions in Tayside, Scotland, and early hard releases without stakeholder engagement stay central in the persistence of negative perceptions amongst stakeholders, whereas early stakeholder involvement and proactive management, such as in Scottish Knapdale and theRiver Otter Beaver Trial, enhances positive attitudes towards beavers. In general, the public in all regions is pro-beaver, while farmers and other landowners predominantly perceive beavers more negative. The research highlights a strong overlap between the knowledge gaps from literature and practice, including the lack of long-term monitoring data, the lack of impact quantification, and the missing standardized management approaches. The research concludes that beavers can enhance socioecological river resilience in the Netherlands. However, their success as NbS depends on multiple factors, where adaptive, landscape-specific management and improved stakeholder engagement are the most important ones. Key recommendations include the inclusion of stakeholders within a national proactive beaver policy, investment in monitoring infrastructure, and integration of ecological, hydrological, and social perspectives to support coexistence between humans and beavers.

108707,Beyond the Surface: Modeling the Energy Efficiency of an Earthworm Robot using analytical and computational methods during its Penetration and Anchoring Phases,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108707,"This thesis investigates the energy demands during the penetration and anchoring phases of a newly proposed earthworm-inspired robot. This new robot features a tip that serves as an expansion chamber to anchor into the soil, while also functioning as a traditional tip for penetrating the soil. Five main models were developed: two analytical and three computational. All estimate the mechanical energy demand required by the earthworm robot during its phases. Among the computational models, the 2D Finite Difference Method was found to be the most accurate and stable, aligning closely with experimental data, while the 3D COMSOL model consistently overestimated values due to limitations in accurately determining soil deformation based on robot depth, leading to unrealistic deformations. In contrast, all analytical models proved accurate based on validation steps. Anchoring was found to require up to two orders of magnitude more energy than penetration, identifying it as the primary optimization target. The proposed tip-anchoring design increases the surface area in contact with the soil, reducing the risk of back-pulling forces that could destabilize the probe's position, making it a promising candidate for improving anchoring performance. Overall, the study validates the models for energy estimation and supports the effectiveness of the proposed design.

108705,Researching and Designing a Digital Tool for Developing and Validating Products Based on Physical Ergonomics,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108705,"The objective of this assignment was to support the integration of physical ergonomics into the product development process by researching, selecting, and designing tools that allow for efficient, fact-based ergonomic design and validation. The research was done for a company that focused mainly on technological development and wanted to upgrade its process by having a digital tool that supports physical ergonomics in product development. Additional goals included: Creating a clear overview of existing digital physical ergonomics tools; Offering a way to obtain clear and fact-based results that can be used to discuss and make design choices; Making clear how and when to use the tools; and providing clarity on the added value of the tool(s)/ workflow.By adding a simple, cost-efficient tool that displays the users' reach zones during development, the company can improve the ease with which physical ergonomics can be optimised in products. Resulting in a more efficient process and more comfort for the end users of their products. Additionally, this tool works together with 2 other scientific tools and gives outcomes that can be used for fact-based decisions and clear communication, both within the company and with clients.The research started with exploring the context and user analysis through employee interviews, and continued as desk research, expert interviews and trying out tools to get a clear view of the market and possible tools. After initial analysis, market research divided existing tools into two types: a centralised tool and purpose-specific tools. Despite their efficiency, a centralised approach such as IPS IMMA turned out too costly to be feasible for the company given their current priority on physical ergonomics. As a result, focus was placed on a purpose-specific tools approach, exploring options for obtaining anthropometric data, displaying ergonomics during development, and validating ergonomics in a product.Through further research, analysis, and iterations, HERO (Human Ergonomic Reach Overlay) was developed. HERO visualises users' physical reach in SolidWorks and integrates with DINED (an anthropometric database) and REBA (an ergonomic assessment method). This simple process supports physical ergonomic product development and provides a fact-based foundation for decision-making and communication. While HERO does not replace an entire workflow, it received positive feedback, improved awareness of the importance of physical ergonomics and sparked hope for its potential within the company. It was concluded that with additional testing, development, and more perspectives, HERO could turn out to be a highly useful tool and open opportunities for more physically ergonomic product development.",Bachelor Industrial Design Engineering (B-IDE),"Jonge, A.M. de",August 2025,English,"No.

108704,Optimizing Oncology Scheduling Under Shortened Infusion Protocols: An Acuity-Informed Approach to Balance Nurse Workload and Operational Efficiency,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108704,"The transition to rapid monoclonal antibody (mAb) infusion protocols offers opportunities to improve oncology care efficiency, yet raises challenges for nurse workload and operational balance. This study develops and evaluates an acuity-informed scheduling framework for Isala Hospital’s oncology day treatment unit, where the MINUTE study enables infusion times as short as 10 minutes. Using historical treatment data and a novel acuity scoring system, a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and a Simulated Annealing (SA) heuristic were designed to optimize appointment allocation. The model explicitly minimizes nurse workload imbalance and bed idle time rather than merely filling time slots. Computational experiments achieved an optimality gap of 0% for baseline cases, while the SA heuristic produced near-optimal solutions within 0.4 minutes, faster than the MILP solver’s 45–90 minute runtime. Scenario analyses demonstrated that reduced infusion times alone do not guarantee smoother operations. Strategies such as alowing more double startups, protected lunch breaks, and reduced startup times improved throughput without overloading nurses. Findings highlight that nurse workload distribution is the primary bottleneck, not physical bed capacity. By embedding acuity and flexibility into scheduling, the framework supports staff well-being and preserves patient-centred care under accelerated protocols.",Master Industrial Engineering and Management (M-IEM),"Klaver, L.W.",September 2025,English,"No

108703,Token Reduction for Transformer-based Position Regression for an Autonomous Football Robot,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108703,"A key task in autonomous mobile robots is to localize their position inside their operating environment. One such application is the autonomous football robot deployed in the reputed RoboCup competition. Such applications demand high accuracy with low computation overhead. Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual localization; however, they depend on large token sequences. A football field has sparse features, i.e., unique features in the field like field lines and goal post are sparsely visible to the robot. This work shows that long token sequences under-perform when fed with input with sparse features. A synthetic image dataset focusing on the RoboCup competition is introduced. Then a transformer-based approach, named RePoseLearner, is proposed which incorporates a CNN backbone and a token reduction method to extract high resolution spatial features and reduce it into a compact yet highly latent token sequence. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has better accuracy and computation time than other methods in the introduced synthetic dataset while still being competitive in a popular indoor dataset.

108700,Shaping Exercise Motivation: Modifying Implicit Associations Through Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM),https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108700,"Background:Regular physical activity benefits health, yet many adults remain inactive despite positive intentions. This intention-behaviour gap suggests that reflective processes alone may not sustain change. Dual-process models highlight the role of implicit evaluations in guiding behaviour. Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) is a technique that can shift such associations in clinical contexts, but its use in physical activity promotion is limited. This study investigated whether a short mobile CBM intervention could influence implicit attitudes and physical activity outcomes, including self-reported activity and daily vigorous minutes. Methods:This study employed a repeated-measures design with a baseline assessment (T0), a three-day app-based CBM intervention, six daily follow-ups (days 1–6), and a posttest on day 7. In total, 32 adults participated at baseline, of whom 8 participants successfully completed the posttest.Implicit attitudes were assessed with the Single-Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT), in which participants classified physical activity words and positive or negative stimuli. Behavioural outcomes included weekly physical activity data, measured with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire–Short Form (IPAQ-SF), and daily vigorous activity minutes, recorded via the TiiM app.Statistical analyses included non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for within-subject comparisons, Spearman’s rho for correlations) due to the small sample size and non-normal distributions. Results:At baseline, no significant associations were observed between physical activity levels and psychological variables, including implicit attitudes, perceived pleasantness, self-efficacy, and intention. Participants were young and already relatively active at baseline, which may have limited detectable intervention effects. Following the intervention, no significant changes were found in implicit attitudes, affective exercise experiences, intentions, or self-reported activity as assessed with the IPAQ-SF. In contrast, daily self-reports via the TiiM app indicated a significant increase in self-reported daily minutes of vigorous physical activity (p= .021,r= .81). Conclusion:The study did not yield evidence that CBM changes implicit attitudes, affective exercise experiences, or intentions likely due to a homogeneous, already active sample. However, daily app tracking suggested increases in vigorous activity.Future research should focus on CBM in less active populations and explore its potential when combined with digital self-monitoring tools to help promote physical activity.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Niederwemmer, L.",September 2025,English,"No

It also seeks to understand the influence that media and record labels have on this perception through the use of framing. Methods: A quantitative survey, cross-sectional survey design was used, focusing on four validated scales measuring perception. A total of 153 full respondents were taken into the analysis. This analysis was performed with RStudio using descriptive statistics, reliability tests, and inferential statistics to explore the relationships between variables. Results: The findings suggest that media and record label framing significantly affect the public perception of posthumous music, especially on the scales of commercial motives and ethical implications. Moreover, the results also highlighted the significant interrelations between measured scales, implying that they do not function independently. Demographic factors showed varying effects. Discussion and Conclusion: The main research question and sub-questions are answered. A critical reflection is provided on the results. Additionally, the limitations of the study are addressed in line with recommendations for future research.

Left ventricular abnormalities (LVA) are particularly relevant as subclinical precursors of heart failure. This thesis aimed to contribute to earlier identification of LVA in T1DM by combining multimodal diagnostic and glycaemic data. In Part I, a research protocol was developed for a predictive model integrating electrocardiogram (ECG), NT-proBNP, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics to enable systematic early risk stratification. In Part II, retrospective analyses were performed in a hospital-based cohort (N=410) to determine the prevalence of LVA and its associations with patient characteristics and glycaemic regulation. Abnormal findings were present in approximately one in five patients undergoing diagnostic testing, with higher prevalence in individuals aged ≥50 years. Univariable regression revealed associations of LVA with age, diabetes duration, sex, and long-term glycaemic control, while CGM-derived metrics such as time-in-range and glycaemic variability provided additional predictive value. Principal component analysis further underscored the interplay of age and glycaemic stability in shaping risk. Together, these findings highlight both the feasibility and necessity of developing targeted, data-driven screening strategies in T1DM. This work provides a conceptual and empirical foundation for predictive modelling, with the ultimate aim of enabling earlier, more personalized detection and prevention of cardiac dysfunction in this high-risk population.",Master Technical Medicine (M-TM),"Woerts, C.A.",September 2025,English,"No

108695,Exploring emotional intelligence through behavioural observations: an exploratory study towards a novel assessment of EI,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108695,"Background:in today’s modern age, many jobs place importance on the soft skills of their employees. One of these soft skills in emotional intelligence (EI), which has been found to be positively related to team performance. However, the measurement of this construct is complicated by the various conceptualisations and problems regarding validity and objectivity of the measures. This is why scholars have called for the development of a measure that solves these problems. Behavioural observations have recently been used to create coding schemes for two concepts that are closely related to EI: psychological safety and caring behaviours. This suggests a similar approach is feasible in the case of EI. Thus, the goal of this thesis is to take the first steps towards a valid and objective measure for EI by exploring EI through behavioural observations. Method:a multi-method approach was taken. 8 videos of retrospective meetings by different teams in a large financial institution were analysed. These videos contained 64 participants, mainly of the Dutch nationality (60.9%). Audiovisual recordings and transcripts of the meetingswere used in analysis. Moments of EI were identified using a blended definition of ability and trait EI. For each moment of EI, the verbal and non-verbal behaviours of the participants were recorded. The context of the meeting, as well as the moments right before and after the moment of EI were recorded. The verbal behaviours were analysed using a modified version of the Gioia method. Results:20 moments of EI were identified. These moments could be divided into two categories: emotional understanding and emotional management. Identification of these moments relied on a combination of (non-)verbal behaviours and context, showing that these factors are highly interconnected. For the category of emotional understanding, a division could be observed between moments of self-oriented and other-oriented emotional understanding. In the category of emotional management, all moments were of the other-oriented type. This is likely because self-oriented emotional management is an internal process that is difficult to observe from the outside. Discussion and conclusion:the main finding of this study is that a simple definition of EI using the categories of emotional understanding and emotional management, each divided into self- and other-oriented, could be appropriate in the case of behavioural observations. Verbal behaviours were more important that non-verbal behaviours to identify moments of EI. Every behaviour had to occur in an appropriate context to be considered a moment of EI. Future research could expand upon the findings of this thesis by using a more rigorous coding process and a more systematic approach to recording non-verbal behaviours.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Eugelink, J.P.",August 2025,English,"No.

108692,Executive Insights Into Emerging Tech: How Decision-Makers of SME+ Organisations Perceive the Business Applications of AI,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108692,"Purpose: Although the organisational implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) contains numerous challenges and opportunities for SME+ enterprises (headcount<1.000), the perceptions that SME+ decision-makers have of AI business applications remains underexplored. The primary objective of this study was to explore the perceptions of SME+ decision-maker of AI business applications. Guided by a theoretical framework on AI topology, business value opportunities and AI perceptions of other relevant stakeholders, perspectives on the benefits, barriers, opportunities, human strengths (relative to AI) and anticipated future impacts of AI were investigated. Method: A qualitative research approach was used in data collection. 14 semi-structured interviews of 60 minutes were conducted with decision-makers of SME+ organisations across a variety of industries. Through inductive coding, perspectives were grouped into common themes and further analysed. Results: This research provides insights across multiple organisational domains, from operational processes, limitations of AI and effective allocation of human resources. A shift was identified in the processes that generate business value, where effective AI deployment enables insight generation to become an integrated component in operational processes. AI was further identified to increase the quality of the goods and services an organisation is able to produce. Furthermore, while AI is said to democratise data access for organisations of all sizes, this research identifies new limitations that have arisen from AI implementation which challenge this narrative, such as higher costs of labour, choosing suitable applications and low oversight of AI usage by employees. Lastly, humans were identified to excel in areas of creativity, physical labour and interpersonal contact compared to AI, and have crucial roles to supervise decision-making of AI-drive processes. Conclusion: This research introduces new perspectives to the field of organisational AI and identifies key areas where and how AI is influencing organisational processes.

However, their accurate detection remains challenging due to complex urban structures and spectral ambiguity. To address this, we developed and evaluated three models trained on SAR-only, optical-only, and combined SAR-optical datasets, each with a spatial resolution of 4 meters and constrained by building footprint masks to improve spatial specificity. The results show that the SAR only model achieved a test F1-score of 0.33, while the optical-only model improved this to 0.39. The combined SAR-optical model achieved the best performance with a test F1- score of 0.49 and a recall of 65.4%, indicating that the combination of structural and spectral features enhances generalization and detection sensitivity. The use of building footprint masks further reduced false positives by limiting predictions to rooftop regions. However, some over predictions were found, especially in dense urban blocks where green roofs on one building affected predictions on adjacent rooftops with similar characteristics. This shows the value of combining multiple data sources and applying spatial masking for green roof detection.

The goal was to create a product that makes using shampoo bars more appealing—especially to consumers who are not yet fully convinced of their benefits. While shampoo bars are a great alternative to traditional liquid shampoo in plastic bottles, many users still find them unfamiliar or unhygienic, particularly when shared in public settings like hotels.The project offers value by supporting HappySoaps' mission: offering 100% plastic-free, recyclable, vegan, and locally made personal care products. A well-designed dispenser can help reduce both plastic use and microplastic pollution, while also improving the everyday experience of users. By solving common objections, like messiness or difficulty of use, the dispenser makes sustainable choices easier and more accessible.The main research question explored was:""How can a product be designed for use in the bathroom that encourages people to use shampoo bars, while improving both hygiene perception and the overall user experience with HappySoaps products?""Based on interviews, surveys, literature reviews, and multiple user tests, three working concepts were developed: a compact travel version, a hand-held flaker, and a wall-mounted slicer. Each concept focused on a different type of user interaction, inspired by kitchen tools for cutting or grating. Prototypes were tested with real users to gather feedback on comfort, hygiene, and usability.In the end, the pencil sharpener style flaker stood out. It was easy to use, minimized direct contact with the shampoo, and matched the HappySoaps brand in look and feel.

108684,Lumina: Intra-Task Static Taint Analysis for RTOS Firmware,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108684,"Embedded systems have become increasingly affordable to manufacture and maintain, leading to their widespread adoption across safety-critical and commercial domains. Real-time operating systems (RTOSs), designed for precise and time-sensitive tasks, are often at the core of such systems. However, these systems remain susceptible to firmware-level attacks throughout their lifecycle, a threat further amplified when devices outlive their official support period. High-profile vulnerabilities like URGENT/11, which affected hundreds of millions of RTOS-based devices, highlight the real-world impact of such security gaps. In this work, we present Lumina, a static analysis framework for detecting taint-style vulnerabilities in stripped RTOS-based firmware. At its core, Lumina performs inter-procedural static taint analysis without relying on symbolic execution, enabling scalable detection of data-flow-based flaws. A key enabler of this analysis is a robust method for identifying user-defined application tasks, even in the absence of debug symbols, often the critical entry points for application logic in RTOS-based systems. This synergy allows us to target analysis to high-value execution paths and identify potential data-flow vulnerabilities. We evaluate Lumina on a combination of real-world and manually compiled RTOS-based firmware samples, demonstrating its ability to identify significantly more user-defined tasks across a wider range of RTOS platforms compared to prior work, while achieving notably fewer false negatives. A large-scale evaluation across 1513 stripped ARM Cortex-M firmware binaries illustrates Lumina’s scalability and practical applicability, successfully recovering 2466 user-defined task candidates. While Lumina identified both taint sources and sinks in 161 samples, no concrete security alerts were raised, highlighting the need for more precise taint source identification in future work. Notably, Lumina is the first system to both recover user-defined tasks in stripped firmware and perform targeted vulnerability detection on them. This also contributes toward addressing the broader challenge of separating system functionality from user-level application code in stripped RTOS firmware, an area that remains difficult and under active exploration.

108680,"The Influence of Amplitude, Pulse Width, and Frequency On Sensation Perception Using Electrocutaneous Stimulation",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108680,"A lot of research is done to improve and increase the number of applications of electrocutaneous stimulation. Use cases for this technology could be social-touch scenarios, more realistic virtual-reality training, or another way to give users additional information ontop of their most used senses, sight and hearing. Electrocutaneous stimulation is a non-intrusive and effective way to convey additional tactile information to users. However, tactile feedback is often underused within the Human-computer interaction domain. Intheory, the technology could be used to recreate complex tactile sensations like touch and pressure, which prove to be difficult to reliably replicate in reality. Existing literature explores different parameters and how they influence the sensation perception using this technology. However, these were focused on functional feedback rather than the recreation of specific, complex sensations. This study focuses on the effects of three key parameters within the electrical wave —amplitude, pulse width, and frequency— on perceived sensations. Twenty participants joined this descriptive quantitative study. Each underwent a calibration process before experiencing 125 stimulations in random order. Participants were asked to give an intensity rating from 0-10 and to choose one of the nineteen provided words from a list. This setup did not show any statistically significant patterns regarding how the three parameters influenced sensation. A large percentage of participants described the stimulations as ’buzzing,’ ’tingling,’ or ’jittery’, suggesting limited perceptual variation, or limitations in how participants could describe their perceived sensation. Refiningsensation descriptors and exploring alternative methodologies could increase the reliability of participant responses.

108678,From utility to connection: a Human-Centred Design exploration of the baby soother,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108678,"This thesis is done in collaboration with Philips Avent and examines the role of one-piece baby soothers in the context of emotional and practical challenges of early parenthood. Soothie is one of the most popular baby soother offered by Philips Avent. Recently its sales started to decline, suggesting a shift in consumer preferences. This change may indicate that today’s parents are seeking more than just functionality in baby products. This thesis aims to reevaluate the current role of soothers as merely practical objects to design a tool which can support parents and babies both practically and emotionally.This thesis combines user needs research and market analysis to design a soother which would satisfy the needs of parents and babies while being relevant for Philips Avent. Literature review demonstrated that soothers, despite having mixed opinions among healthcare professionals and researchers, are still preferred by parents due to their positive impact on overall relationships between parents and babies. Qualitative analysis of the customer reviews highlighted the importance of designing products which are relevant for the infant’s developmental stage and integrate seamlessly in the daily life. Insights from market research and portfolio analysis further emphasized the need for empathetic and emotional approach, which should be reflected in shapes and function of the soother but also in its market positioning.Incorporating the results from the research phase, the thesis demonstrates the process of development of three soother concepts: soother with teething functionality, interaction-based soother with the focus on physical touch, and routine-based soother featuring massage elements. In-depth interviews with parents showed that parents had a particularly strong preference for soothers that combine teething and comforting functions and for soothers that encourage connection through physical touch. These findings highlight a clear opportunity for future iterations to centre on soothing solutions that include teething support to provide comforting and developmentally relevant soothers.",Bachelor Industrial Design Engineering (B-IDE),"Kulakova, P.A.",August 2025,English,"No

108676,Ideal Compaction Window for Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) mixtures based on mechanical properties,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108676,"This thesis investigates the ideal compaction window for Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) mixtures, focusing on the mechanical properties, density and cracking resistance. With the asphalt industry transitioning from Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) to the more environmentally sustainable WMA, there is a need for clear guidelines on achieving optimal compaction at the lower processing temperatures. This research, conducted in collaboration with TWW (Twentse Weg- en Waterbouw BV) and the ASPARi workgroup at the University of Twente, aims to fill that knowledge gap.The study focuses on SMA-NL 11 asphalt mixtures containing 50% recycled material and the additive Lynpave (SMA-NL 11 50% PR 40/60 Lynpave). A four-phase methodology was employed, consisting of a desk study, laboratory experiments (utilising Marshall and wedge splitting tests), field testing, and a final analysis of the combination of the results in the other three phases. Results show that the mechanical properties, density, and fracture energy decrease significantly when the compaction temperature drops. Based on experimental results, the ideal compaction window is defined between 145.2 °C and 97.1 °C, corresponding to an approximate time frame of 0 to 7 minutes after paving. This time window can vary substantially depending on parameters such as ambient temperature, wind speed, layer thickness, base temperature, and operational strategies.Laboratory tests showed that compaction within this temperature window results in higher density and cracking resistance, whereas compaction outside this range, particularly below 80 °C, led to poor workability and reduced mechanical strength of the WMA. Field validation at multiple sites confirms the trends observed in the lab. The use of thermologgers, infrared temperature measuring and nuclear density gauges proved effective for monitoring field conditions.This research concludes that identifying and adhering to the defined compaction window significantly improves the quality of WMA pavements. The study recommends the integration of real-time temperature monitoring tools and tailored operator strategies, and suggests further research into other WMA types and variable climatic conditions.

108675,"Comparison of hybrid, deep learning and conceptual models for streamflow simulation in the typhoon-stricken area of Zhejiang province",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108675,"This research will make a comparison between a conceptual model, an artificial intelligence (AI) model, and a hybrid version of these two models in the context of daily streamflow simulation. Furthermore, a comparison of the model performances in a specific typhoon situation will be made.For this research, the conceptual model is already available and is the Xin’anjiang (XAJ) conceptual model. The hybrid and AI models are specifically constructed for this research.There is also an hourly soil moisture dataset from measuring stations available for this study area, for the period of 2022-2025. However, it was unknown if this dataset is usable for the purpose of streamflow simulation. A secondary goal of this research was, therefore, to estimate the usability of that dataset.This research starts by testing the usability of the 2022-2025 dataset, and the main problem with this dataset is that there is no outflow data available for the same period. A second, satellite-based soil moisture dataset is therefore obtained. A very strong relationship between these two datasets was found, and the satellite dataset was transformed to resemble the measuring station soil moisture dataset. This transformation was then used to transform the satellite dataset for the period for which outflow data was available (2011-2020); this newly created dataset was then called the quantile dataset. Both the satellite and quantile datasets were then used as inputs in the different models.The construction of the models started with the conclusion that the hybrid model will be the same as the conceptual model, except for the difference that the hybrid model will have an integrated AI module that predicts the soil moisture. This soil moisture value will then partly replace the bucket system of the conceptual model. At first, this AI component was made; this component was created in the form of a long short-term memory (LSTM) model. This component was then tested on its ability to predict the soil moisture, and the satellite-based model significantly outperformed the quantile-based model.After this, the full AI model was constructed, also based on the LSTM principle. For this model, the differences between the results of the quantile dataset and the satellite dataset were smaller, but the satellite still outperformed the quantile dataset.After this, the hybrid model was constructed, and all three types of models were compared to each other. The AI model scored best on the overall streamflow simulation capabilities, with an NSE of 0.92 compared to 0.84 and 0.83 for the hybrid and conceptual models, respectively. For the typhoon situation, the hybrid model outperformed the other models; however, this result was probably an overestimation of the model’s capabilities.The overall conclusion of this research is that the 2022-2025 dataset is not usable for daily streamflow simulation for periods other than 2022-2025. Furthermore, additional soil moisture data does improve model accuracy. Lastly, an AI model in the form of an LSTM is capable of streamflow simulation and holds potential for use in other catchments.

Through semi-structured interviews, this study identifies graduates' attitudes towards SDL, its effects on their character, behavior, and skills, and its current role in their personal and professional lives. Findings indicate that most participants hold positive attitudes toward SDL, though some expressed concerns about its implementation. Graduates described SDL either as a subconscious influence on their mindset or as a deliberate tool to be applied in specific contexts. Reported outcomes prominently included enhanced autonomy, reflective skills, decision-making and planning abilities, self-confidence, and motivation. However, some limitations were noted, such as difficulties in managing failure and tensions between SDL-acquired mindsets and workplace expectations.

108672,"The influence of riverine wetlands on flood and drought mitigation: a case study for the Aa, the Netherlands",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108672,"Extreme weather, leading to changes in river discharge, requires proper water management to reduce the impacts of floods and droughts. In the past, hard structures, such as weirs or pumping stations, have been implemented to address such hazards, but more recently the focus has shifted toward Nature-based Solutions (NbS), such as wetlands, due to their multifunctional benefits. However, the functioning of these wetlands in relation to flood and drought reduction remains insufficiently understood, as many factors influence their effectiveness. Therefore, a case study was conducted to investigate to what extent a wetland is a suitable solution for flood and drought reduction in the Aa catchment (North-Brabant, The Netherlands). Before implementing wetlands, it is crucial to determine suitable locations and types, as these greatly affect their performance. A literature study was conducted to identify the most suitable riverine wetland types for the area and on how suitable riverine wetland locations can be determined. This was assessed using the framework ofStoorvogel & Antle (2001), which distinguishes between opportunity space (physical suitability) and decision space (institutional and stakeholder suitability). While many wetland types were found to be physically feasible, local characteristics and stakeholder preferences proved significant, and no universally optimal riverine wetland type could be determined for the entire Aa catchment. For determining suitable locations, a list of criteria and constraints was compiled based on literature. This included criteria from the opportunity space, such as wetness, land use, size, upstream position, soil type, slope, and restoration versus creation, along with decision space criteria including landownership, proximity to urban areas, stakeholder preferences, zoning- and nature management plans. To assess the potential hydrological impact, a SWAT+ model of the catchment was developed to represent the reference scenario. Due to limitations in model performance, the model was only used to compare relative differences between scenarios. Two potential wetland locations, one upstream and one downstream, were selected based on the established criteria and in consultation with the province of North-Brabant, a key stakeholder. For each location, both a forested and non-forested wetland type were implemented in the model, resulting in four different wetland scenarios. These were compared to the reference scenario on different hydrological aspect using key performance indicators (KPIs). For floods, peak flow and flood volume were assessed. For droughts, the number of dry days, duration of dry periods, and water deficit were evaluated. Results on flood mitigation showed substantial relative reductions for all scenarios: over 15% for 1-day peak flows and flood volume, a reduction of around 31% in peak flows for multi-day flood events, and flood volumes reduced by up to 41% for multi-day flood events. Even though the model tends to overestimate the impact of wetlands on flood reduction, still some conclusions can be drawn. No significant differences were observed between the different wetland types or locations. It was concluded that riverine wetlands, regardless of type or location, significantly contribute to flood reduction under current climate conditions. For drought mitigation, the downstream wetland scenarios showed reductions in drought severity across all KPIs, especially for extreme droughts. The upstream scenarios showed mixed results, indicating both reductions and increases in drought indicators. Due to high sensitivity of the results to methodological choices, no general conclusion could be drawn on the impact of wetlands on drought mitigation. In conclusion, while wetlands reduce flood impact in the Aa catchment, their effect on drought reduction remains uncertain. However, for both floods and droughts wetlands seem to decrease the duration of these extreme events. No significant difference was found between different wetland types indicating differences in wetland type do not have a large impact on the effectiveness of wetlands on mitigating high or low flows. Due to some model limitations and the uncertainty in the effect of drought reduction by wetlands, further research is recommended.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"Oosterhout, M.J. van",August 2025,English,"No

108671,An Empirical Evaluation of AI’s Potential to Solve Requirement Analysis Problems,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108671,"Requirements engineering (RE) plays a pivotal role in the success of complex engineering projects; yet practitioners often face persistent challenges with requirement clarity, ambiguity, and time-consuming classification tasks. This research investigates how Artificial Intelligence, specifically GPT-based large language models, can address these issues during the requirement analysis phase. This research employed a mixed-methods approach that combined structured surveys to identify problems found by engineers, selection of an AI tool for solving the found problems, systematic calibration of an AI tool tailored to requirement analysis strategy, controlled experiments assessing the tool’s performance with practicing engineers, and quantitative benchmarking evaluations measuring classification accuracy, processing speed, and overall usability, aiming for evaluate where/if artificial intelligence has potential to solve problems engineers face during requirement analysis. Key findings indicate that GPT-based tools enhance engineer analysis on the clarity and consistency of requirements, enabling them to classify requirements more rapidly and with improved accuracy.Usability evaluations revealed that engineers found the AI-assisted tool intuitive and beneficial, even without prior experience with AI systems. An independent third-party evaluator confirmed that AI-assisted outputs exhibited more transparent structure and more reliable requirement type categorization compared to traditional manual analysis. The tool achieved a throughput of approximately 100–200 requirements analyzed per hour, representing a substantial improvement over traditional manual analysis methods, which typically process only 10–15 requirements per hour. Overall, the results demonstrate that AI can effectively mitigate the two primary problems faced by engineers: unclear or ambiguous requirements and the significant amount of time required to analyze them. These results offer companies such as IV Group, which opened their space and provided data to test the tool, practical pathways to accelerate project timelines, reduce engineering workload, and improve stakeholder communication. The study contributes to the academic understanding of human-AI collaboration in requirements engineering, laying a foundation for integrating AI tools into engineering practices while also highlighting the need for transparency and user trust in AI adoption.

Pregnancy and motherhood, and menopause are major transitions in women’s lives, reshaping them physically, emotionally, socially and in their sense of identity. Yet, these transitions remain medicalised and understudied, often overlooking women’s voices. This study examined women’s expectations and experiences through qualitative accounts and quantitative analyses, focusing on women’s narratives, the links between pregnancy and motherhood, and menopause expectations and experiences, as well as differences in expectations by motherhood status (women with vs. without children). Methods.Two online surveys with self-developed open-ended questions were used, focusing on either pregnancy and motherhood or menopause. 183 female participants (ages 18 to 78) were recruited using convenience and snowball sampling. The qualitative data were analysed in Atlas.ti and the quantitative data in RStudio through thematic and statistical analyses. Results.Women’s expectations and experiences were shaped by physical, social and identity changes, symptoms, emotions, social comparisons and cultural narratives. Expectations were often absent, incomplete or idealised, leading to misjudgements or underestimations of the intensity of actual experiences. Quantitatively, a significant association emerged between positive experiences of pregnancy and motherhood and negative expectations of menopause. Women with children reported more positive expectations of pregnancy and motherhood, while women without children were significantly more likely to report no expectations at all. Conclusion. Women’s experiences of pregnancy, motherhood and menopause are complex and often differ from their expectations, which can leave them unprepared. This study shows that aligning expectations with experiences is crucial.

PTSD symptoms, sleep reduction symptoms and test anxiety symptoms are a common factor but remain unexplored. This study aimed to examine the bidirectional relationship between PTSD symptoms, sleep reduction symptoms and test anxiety symptoms, including the differences for gender and adolescence stages (young and middle adolescence). Methods.In total, 5,933 adolescents completed a general health screening, out of which a predefined subsample of 1,981 completed questionnaires on PTSD and test anxiety. Participants were aged 12–19 years, and inclusion required complete data on sleep reduction, PTSD, and test anxiety symptoms. The final analytic sample comprised of 1,981 adolescents (M= 14.23,SD= 1.19), with the late adolescent group (17–19 years;N= 42) excluded from analyses. Data were analysed in R using descriptive statistics, non-parametric tests, and structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine bidirectional associations. Multi-group SEM analyses were conducted to test differences by gender and adolescent stage, and model fit was evaluated with standard indices (CFI, TLI, RMSEA, SRMR). Results.All three symptom domains (sleep reduction symptoms, PTSD symptoms, and test anxiety symptoms) showed significant bidirectional associations. Multi-group analyses indicated no meaningful differences between early and middle adolescents. Gender, however, influenced the strength of associations, with consistently stronger relationships observed in females compared to males. Conclusion.This study demonstrates that sleep reduction, PTSD, and test anxiety symptoms are significantly and bidirectionally related in adolescence. While associations were largely consistent across early and middle adolescent stages, gender differences emerged, with stronger symptom interrelations observed in females. These findings highlight the importance of considering multiple, interacting symptom domains when assessing adolescent mental health and suggest that interventions may benefit from a gender-sensitive approach.

GeoTwin combines a rapid flood simulation service (FastFlood) with a WebGL-based 3D rendering pipeline to show flood scenarios and impacts to stakeholders.From the client, users set up a simulation and request results from the FastFlood service. The platform downloads the resulting water-height GeoTIFF and processes it into a grid of flood polygons for near real-time visualization. Flood layers are rendered using the engine’s terrain-hugging pipeline and a dedicated water shader to show semi-transparent, terrain-conforming inundation surfaces over 3D context layers. An embedded impact analysis module sums up precomputed affected buildings per flood grid cell into impact indicators (e.g. buildings at risk, estimated occupants, economic value) with category reporting and simple threshold-based risk levels.GeoTwin’s architecture prioritizes accessibility (no plugins, commodity hardware), transparency (open source implementation) and stakeholder-oriented design. The prototype shows an end-to-end workflow simulation request, raster processing, terrain-conforming rendering and impact analysis all in a web application.

Deep learning algorithms have proven effective in detecting and classifying arrhythmia; however, they are complex and typically require power-hungry devices to run. This limits their deployment in portable or real-time medical applications, where low-power and efficient solutions are critical. Current approaches employ compact deep learning models that maintain high data precision and accurate arithmetic operations. These models aim to balance computational efficiency with the need for reliable medical diagnoses. In medical applications, a reliable diagnosis is critical; therefore, approximate arithmetic is typically avoided, as it can degrade classification performance and compromise patient safety. However, research has shown that approximations have minimal impact on classification performance, as deep learning models exhibit high error resilience. To reduce power consumption and enable implementation on wearable devices, this thesis proposes incorporating approximations into an artificial neural network, aiming to lower power usage while maintaining strong classification performance.A model and its corresponding hardware architecture were adopted from existing literature, and techniques such as data precision reduction and the integration of approximate multipliers were applied. The model is trained on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database using the TensorFlow library. VHDL implementations of the model using various state-of-the-art approximate multipliers were developed, validated, and synthesized using the Synopsys Design Compiler. After which power numbers will be generated. Results have shown an 81\% power reduction while maintaining a 93\% classification accuracy and 92\% classification sensitivity. The lower power consumption enables longer battery life in wearable devices whilst keeping state-of-the-art classification performance.",Master Embedded Systems (M-EMSYS),"Bulten, F.F.",August 2025,English,"No

108652,Food Waste in the Supermarket of the Future: A qualitative study towards identifying design opportunities for OneThird,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108652,"This thesis project researches the role of food waste in the supermarket of the future to provide a recommendation on design spaces to OneThird, a Dutch company that develops fruit scanners to predict the shelf life and ripeness of certain fruits and vegetables. With this technology, their goal is to reduce waste by eliminating destructive quality checks and squeezing of avocados on the shop floor.However, since both the supermarket and food waste are continuously evolving, an effective solution today may not be effective in the future. Therefore, it is essential that OneThird gains knowledge on how the supermarket might change, so that their research and technology can adapt to make a long-term impact. Thus, this thesis explores the supermarket of the future in the context of food waste and fresh produce management to provide OneThird with insights to help them develop their technology to remain relevant and impactful.To explore this design space, the following research question was formulated: “How might OneThird evolve its technology to stay relevant in the supermarket of the future while remaining committed to reducing food waste?”. To answer it, a multi-layered research approach was taken. This approach aims to explore and analyse the problem from three different levels: the overarching broader perspective, the industry perspective and the consumer perspective. This was done through a literature review, expert interviews and a consumer survey. With the insights from all three data collection methods, the thesis builds towards providing OneThird with a recommendation of design spaces and opportunities where their research and technology could play a role in the future.The result is a collection of 12 insight statements and 12 design opportunities that cover an array of topics where improvements could be made pertaining to retail, as well as other stages of the food supply chain, like logistics and the consumer. This, again, is due to the systemic nature of food waste because aiming to influence the supermarket will likely influence other players, both upstream and downstream, in the food supply chain. Thus, it is important to have knowledge of the needs from the different perspectives.Furthermore, the design opportunities have been placed in an impact-feasibility matrix to help with prioritization and provide feedback to OneThird on where the majority of their efforts should be focused. Overall, the results aim to inform OneThird’s design process and strategy, both long-term and short-term.",Bachelor Industrial Design Engineering (B-IDE),"Salters, K.L.",August 2025,English,"No

108650,Governing ecosystems in the construction industry: Translating needs into strategy,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108650,"The construction industry is characterised by temporal complexities and fragmentation, and the resulting lack of strategic and long-term collaboration causes the sector to lag in terms of productivity improvement. Partnering is considered as a fruitful way to improve performance within the industry, and novel concepts such as collaboration within ecosystems have been explored recently. Just like their biological counterparts, ecosystems in business environments evolve when adapting to changes in their environment. To support this evolution, the governance of an ecosystem must be able to respond to these changes accordingly. The aim of this study is thus to explore how a governance strategy can be formulated to adapt to an ecosystem’s governance needs, given that these are influenced by external uncertainties. A scenario study supports the exploration of external factors and their influence on governance needs, resulting in four dominant governance needs for ecosystems: to prevent opportunism, increase efficiency, improve competitiveness, and increase capability. The results suggest that if external factors cause a different governance need to become dominant, the governance strategy needs to adapt accordingly. A governance strategy was found to consist of three dynamic governance mechanisms that can turn into governance practices to fulfil specific governance needs. These dynamic governance mechanisms are identified as 1) the balance between contractual and relational agreements, 2) the degree of flexibility of these agreements, and 3) the intensity of monitoring the compliance with these agreements. Practitioners are encouraged to continuously assess whether the external context causes a change in their ecosystems’ governance needs and adapt their governance strategy accordingly through the consideration of abovementioned mechanisms.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"Kok, E.",July 2025,English,"No

108649,Urban Heat Stress Assessment in Hengelo Through Thermal Walks to Guide the Implementation of Green-Blue Infrastructure for Urban Cooling,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108649,"Climate change and urbanisation have intensified the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, exposing cities to higher temperatures and increasing risks to public health. This thesis explores how Green-Blue Infrastructure (GBI) can improve outdoor thermal comfort in Hengelo, a medium-sized Dutch city with limited microclimate data and spatial constraints that complicate climate adaptation. The research combines spatial analysis withthermal walks,a method linking environmental measurements with participant perceptions. Five locations were studied using Kestrel 5400 trackers at intervention and reference points, alongside surveys on thermal sensation and comfort. Results show that dense tree cover provided the strongest cooling, lowering Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) by more than 20°C and being rated as most comfortable. Partial vegetation showed moderate effects, while blue infrastructure without shade, such as ponds and fountains, offered little physical relief despite some psychological comfort. Discussions with municipal representatives confirmed the potential of GBI but also highlighted barriers such as dense underground infrastructure, competing land uses, and the need for visibility in central areas. The study recommends site-specific strategies: prioritising trees where feasible, combining green and blue elements in open areas, and using alternatives like pergolas or vertical greenery in constrained spaces. Beyond its findings, the research shows the value of thermal walks for connecting objective data with lived experience, offering a replicable method for other mid-sized European cities.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"Belardo, G.",August 2025,English,"No.

108646,A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH FOR PREDICTING BRIDGE STRUCTURAL RESPONSE,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108646,"Bridges are critical components of modern civil infrastructure facilitating transportation, trade, and connectivity. These vital structures are designed to be subjected to daily loads from vehicles, pedestrians, and environmental forces, making their maintenance and good functionality essential. However, bridges are also predisposed to deterioration over time due to aging materials, operational fatigue, and environmental effects such as temperature fluctuations and corrosion. Maintaining bridges in a safe and functional state can be a costly endeavour. The American Society of Civil Engineers [ASCE] reported that in the United States, over $125 billion is required annually for bridge rehabilitation and maintenance to prevent structural failures and ensure safety (ASCE, 2021). Despite these significant investments, limited resources and growing infrastructure demands necessitate innovative monitoring solutions to optimize maintenance schedules and detect defects early, thus minimizing both costs and risks.One of the greatest challenges in maintaining civil infrastructure lies in detecting defects at an early stage, ideally with minimal manual intervention. Traditional visual inspections consist of an expert periodically traveling and observing the structure, thus are costly and susceptible to human error (Brownjohn, 2007). A more modern structural health monitoring [SHM] strategy reduces the frequency of site visits by their caretakers, them being replaced with long-term observation of data collected from sensors, interpretation of damage-sensitive features and statistical analysis (Brownjohn, 2004). Bridges are particularly prone to structural deformations caused by a wide range of load types, including seismic, wind, thermal, live, and dead loads. While traditional design processes consider these loads during the modelling phase, within the lifetime of a bridge, complex interactions can occur and thus deviate from initial conditions. Among these factors, thermal loads, influenced by daily and seasonal temperature variations, can be particularly significant, sometimes surpassing the effects of live loads depending on the bridge's material composition (Catbas et al., 2008). Thus, emphasising the need for detailed monitoring and analysis of thermal effects in bridge structures.Advances in sensor technology, computational power and data analytics have enabled data-driven approaches to structural health monitoring, offering new opportunities to assess the dynamic response of bridges under various loads. By integrating sensors, analysts can capture critical parameters such as local stress, temperature, tilt and acceleration, which collectively describe the natural response of a structure. After preparation, these datasets are then analysed to identify trends, anomalies, or patterns indicative of structural health and performance. Strain gauges measure localized deformations, providing insights into material behaviour under stress; thermistors measure local temperature, essential for understanding temperature-induced effects; and accelerometers capture vibration characteristics, including natural frequencies and mode shapes. All of these being sensitive indicators of structural health. Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE) UT research group(s)",,"Tene, M.",May 2025,English,"No.

Drawing on the Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986), and Dual-Coding Theory (Paivio & Csapo, 1973), the study hypothesized that emotionally charged visuals, urgent text, and their congruency would increase audience engagement and perceived message impact. A 2x2 between-subjects experiment was conducted (N = 113), where participants were randomly assigned to view one of four manipulated Instagram news posts. Manipulation checks confirmed that participants recognized the intended differences in urgency and image intensity. However, results from the multivariate analyses (MANOVA) indicated no statistically significant effects of urgency, intensity, or their interaction on any of the three outcome variables. These findings raise questions about the assumed persuasive power of emotional intensity and urgency in fast-paced, low-attention social media environments. Possible explanations include participant desensitization due to news fatigue. The study highlights the importance of testing media effects in real-world settings, and suggests that future research should consider a more immersive design.

108644,Revive the KUKA youBot to build an easy-to-use and flexible interface to operate it,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108644,"The KUKA youBot of the University of Twente has not been operational in years. With renewed interest in the robot from a theatre perspective, the goal of this project is to revive the youBot and enable it for development of expressive, safe and robust puppeteering.However, the current youBot software stack is vastly outdated and needs to be re-written for an up-to-date version of ROS2. The focus of this project is on the software technical aspects of upcycling the youBot. The aim is to keep as much of the youBot's original hardware as possible, without it intervening with software development.Therefore, only the onboard-computer, battery pack, and emergency button are replaced. All other hardware is kept and taken into account in the design of the new software stack.The project focusses on creating a solid foundation for future development and re-instating the youBot's basic functionality.Therefore, items and features like specific input devices, intuitive input-to-output mappings, the creation of different controller modes, and animal-like behaviour of the youBot are out-of-scope for this project.Nevertheless, the software stack should enable to implement these kind of features in the future. A new software stack for the youBot is written for ROS2.The architecture consists of three main layers; the input adapter, controllers, and EtherCAT adapter.The input adapter is for interaction with the youBot on the input side, enabling the configuration of different input-devices and input-to-output mappings.The controller layer converts high level commands to individual wheel- and joint-commands.The EtherCAT adapter sits as far downstream in the ROS2-domain as possible, bridging the ROS2-domain and EtherCAT-domain, and ensures all commands pass through the safety layer before reaching the wheels and joints. Several safety features are implemented for operating the youBot in close proximity of humans.These are software and hardware emergency buttons and a feature monitoring the operational status of the system. Each of these features put the youBot to a halt with no noticeable latency when triggered.Additionally, the youBot is partly prevented from damaging itself via endstop protection in the form of implementation of virtual endstops.Before reaching these virtual endstops, the joint velocity is clamped based on its current velocity, ensuring a timely slowdown. The general operation of the youBot, latency between input and output, and all safety features are tested and work as intended.Furthermore, a test is performed in which a new input-device is configured successfully.Documentation on the software stack is written to provide easy onboarding of future developersand aid understandability and extendability of the youBot's capabilities.Additionally, a detailed step-by-step guide on how to get the youBot up and running is created.All documentation is validated by a third party not directly involved in development. Limitations of the project still exist in the form of non-implemented self-collision prevention or ground-collision protection.Furthermore, the encoders of the gripper fingers turned out unreliable due to inconsistent values for open and closed finger positions and have been taken out of scope. With the youBot being up and running again, the goal of revival can be concluded to be reached.The system architecture allows for future extension of youBot's capabilities and theatre-tailored features,aided by extensive documentation.

108643,“Ever rooted for the bad guy?” The Role of Empathy and Moral Foundations in Parasocial Relationships with Fictional Heroes and Antiheroes,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108643,"This study examined how viewers’ parasocial relationships (PSR) with fictional heroes and antiheroes are shaped by empathy and moral foundations. Whereas previous parasocial research has primarily defined PSR as positive, stable bonds with morally consistent characters, this study addresses a crucial gap in PSR research by including morally ambiguous antiheroes. A quantitative, within-subjects online survey was used to measure the degree of empathy, assess the moral foundations and PSR strength of 185 participants. Participants were able to self-select fictional heroes and antiheroes that resonate with them. The findings indicated that PSRs with heroes are significantly stronger compared to antiheroes. Empathetic concern, an empathy dimension, positively predicted PSR with heroes but not with antiheroes. Fairness as an individualising moral foundation was found to predict stronger PSR with heroes, whereas authority was the only significant predictor for antiheroes. Shortened empathy and morality scales caused methodological issues, impacting construct validity and reliability. However, these results highlight how viewers’ moral and emotional prepositions affect these intricate parasocial bonds.

108642,GENERATIVE 3D TECHNOLOGY IN COMPLEX LOWER LIMB  MALALIGNMENT: ADVANCING TOWARDS A FULLY AUTOMATED 3D  ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108642,"Rational:Lower limb malalignment is a major contributor to the progression of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and increasing knee-related symptoms. Although three-dimensional (3D) lower limb alignment analysis is increasingly recognized as essential for diagnosis and preoperative surgical planning of multiplanar deformities, current semi-automated protocols remain time-intensive, personnel-dependent, and lack standardization. Automation and a systematic understanding of methodological discrepancies in this field would therefore be highly valuable. This thesis aimed to develop and validate a fully automated 3D lower limb alignment analysis protocol and to systematically evaluate and compare existing methods to better understand their differences. Method:A fully automated SkeletonPlanner protocol was developed by integrating the semi-automated 3D Lab protocol, enabling 3D alignment analysis that combines statistical shape model- and script-based landmarking for new patients. Validation was performed on 50 lower limbs with KOA from the IMI-APPROACH cohort, with outcomes including angular accuracy and reliability, axis lengths, landmark placement, and segmentation quality, benchmarked against the 3D Lab protocol. In addition, a literature review was conducted to examine discrepancies in definitions and methods regarding landmarks, axes, coordinate systems, and angles. Finally, these methods were directly compared with the 3D Lab protocol to quantify methodological differences. Results:The SkeletonPlanner improved efficiency, reduced reliance on specialized personnel, and achieved clinically acceptable accuracy for key angles and mechanical axis length, with all median absolute deviations within predefined limits. The PDFA, tibial exorotation, and mLDTA remained challenging. Landmark detection was accurate for 32 of 33 anatomical landmarks (<5 mm), segmentation was comparable, and overall reliability was high, except for one angle with low agreement. The literature review revealed substantial variability in definitions of landmarks, axes and coordinate systems, which was confirmed in the comparative analysis. Variations in axis definitions affected the orientation of anatomical planes, but generally had limited impact on angle measurements, except for femoral anteversion. Moreover, different sagittal and transverse axis definitions caused direct angular discrepancies, particularly in tibial exorotation. Conclusion: This thesis introduces and validates SkeletonPlanner, a fully automated 3D alignment protocol that substantially reduces operator dependency while preserving accuracy and reliability. Beyond providing a clinically viable tool, this work clarifies methodological discrepancies in the field, laying the foundation for standardization and large-scale automated assessments. Ultimately, these advances have the potential to improve preoperative osteotomy planning and support more consistent clinical decision-making in KOA care and lower limb malalignment.",Master Technical Medicine (M-TM),"Mol, S.P.",September 2025,English,"No

108640,Coupling of hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling with local fishers’ knowledge to assess climate change impact uncertainty in a tropical river.,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108640,"Colombia’s Magdalena–Cauca basin supplies water, food and income to ∼80% of the national population, yet simultaneously habitat alteration, contamination and socio-economic marginalization alreadythreaten its flood-pulse wetlands and artisanal fisheries. Climate change adds another layer of risk tothese vulnerable systems. Existing climate-impact studies typically follow one of two paths: a purelybiophysical “top-down” chain that feeds global-climate-model (GCM) projections through basin-scalehydrological and reach-scale hydrodynamic models, or a “bottom-up” social-science approach thatgathers local knowledge through participatory interviews. The two strands are rarely combined. Thisstudy asks how these paths can be merged and where they complement or challenge each other whenassessing the effects of climate change. To do this, this study deploys a coupled model study linking adistributed hydrological model with a 1D/2DH hydrodynamic model. It also complements the modeling bottom-up semi-structured interviews with local fishers.Four weighted climate ensembles (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 126, 245, 370, 585) were derivedfrom averaging different climate models for the periods 2030-2060 and 2070-2100. These were interpolated using inverse-distance weighting. These forcings drove a distributed 2 km x 2 km WFLOW-HBVhydrological model. Seasonal Nash Sutcliffe efficiency scores were 0.52 for the Magdalena River and0.71 for the Cauca River. From the continuous daily simulations, 1-in-5-year high- and low-flow eventswere selected using the volume-above/-below-threshold metric. This method retains full hydrographshape for subsequent hydraulic modeling. The climate ensembles indicate a basin wide dip in rainfallin the near term and an increase in the long term, while temperatures rise by about 3 °C relativeto 1990-2020. At Regidor (Magdalena) and Caucasia (Cauca) the extreme-event hydrographs swingbetween a 30% deficit and a 25% surplus, with no consistent ranking across scenarios or time slices.This highlights how the weighted ensembles can blur the highest extremes.We applied a coupled 1D/2DH SOBEK hydrodynamic model over a 40 km reach around Magangu´e,driven by discharge hydrographs from the hydrological model and a downstream stage–dischargerelation. Validation showed water level errors of up to one meter while agreement between satellitederived and modeled wetland flood extent reached 88.2%. During low flow conditions smaller andpoorly connected wetlands remained below dry season thresholds for up to twice as long. The effect isstrongest in the near-future SSP 370 and SSP 585 scenarios, effectively severing river–wetland links.In contrast, high-flow events produced only modest peak increases but expanded floodplain inundation by roughly 5–10 %, temporarily restoring connectivity across all scenarios.Seven artisanal fishers (ages 30–69, village- and city-based) created causal “reaction maps” and discussed risks, responsibilities, and solutions, following an interview protocol designed to elicit localclimate imaginaries. Low-flows are perceived as the main threat: loss of river–wetland connectivity shrinks spawning habitat, lower oxygen levels, and reduced species diversity. High-flows divideopinions: some welcome larger wetland area, others fear gear loss, swept-away fish and bank erosion.Reduced catch translates into either food insecurity (remote villages) or lost income (cities). Alternatives (subsistence farming, informal transport, urban migration) are risky and socially disruptive.The research shows that the model setup can represent only a subset of the key processes identified byfishers. As a result, a top-down approach may overlook important effects of climate change. In somecases, the loss of system complexity introduced by the model can outweigh its added value. Futureprojects should begin with a careful exploration of stakeholders and a bottom-up description of thekey processes. Only then should modeling be considered. If the stakeholder processes relate directlyto the water system and the model can capture them without large reductions in complexity, a modelis justified. When key processes cannot be captured, an extensive stakeholder analysis may be moreuseful. In this regard, semi-structured interviews combined with system mapping proved especiallyvaluable.

As the need for innovative solutions intensifies, robotic avatars, remotely operated robots designed to simulate physical presence, offer potential support for overburdened healthcare systems. This qualitative study explores the perceptions, expectations, and concerns of key stakeholders about the implementation of robotic avatars in the care of individuals with traumatic brain injury. Interviews were conducted with clients living in residential care homes (N=4), their direct caregivers (N=5), and team leaders (N=5) at SGL, a Dutch healthcare organization specializing in TBI rehabilitation.Guided by the Technology Acceptance Model and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology,a hybrid thematic analysis was conducted using both deductive and inductive coding. Deductive themes were drawn from constructs such as perceived usefulness, ease of use, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Inductive themes included time and workload pressure, value of human contact, conditional trust in technology, the idea that robots should be supportive but not replacing human care, distinctions between acceptable and unacceptable tasks, and implementation challenges. Thematic analysis showed a shared openness to robotic avatars, provided they are introduced as supportive tools rather than replacements for human caregivers. Across all groups, participants identified clear boundaries: while avatars were welcomed for logistical and repetitive tasks (e.g., handing over items, remote monitoring), emotional care and interpersonal connection were deemed irreplaceable. Clients valued autonomy and reduced dependency, but emphasized emotional safety and clarity about the robot’s role. Caregivers expressed cautious optimism, conditioned by concerns about technical reliability, emotional authenticity, and enough training. Team leaders highlighted the importance of stakeholder involvement, financial feasibility, and strategic planning for successful implementation.Findings underscore the need for gradual, transparent integration of robotic avatars, with strong co-design and user support. Factors such as emotional acceptance, trust, and personalization emerged as critical for adoption, indicating that traditional models of technology acceptance may be insufficient on their own. This study contributes new insights into how relational, ethical, and practical considerations must guide the integration of emerging technologies in vulnerable care settings.

Using the data from a large cross-sectional study (N = 2163), this research explores the prevalence and variation of the five subscales of the DOI (Change Unnecessary, Conflicting Goals, Interpersonal Relations, Lacking Knowledge, and Tokenism). This was done for all three aforementioned crises. Descriptive and Inferential statistics (MANOVA) showed that while some barriers appear to be consistent across contexts, variations exist between crises. It has been found that a lack of motivation for behavioural change is connected to the mindset that the change itself is not necessary between the crisis. In the climate crisis, people referred to symbolic actions, in the energy crisis, a lack of knowledge was mostly mentioned as a barrier for behavioural change, and during the COVID crisis, individuals mostly felt that change was simply not needed. The findings suggest that most barriers (Interpersonal Relations, Conflicting Goals, Tokenism and Lacking Knowledge) were stable across different contexts, which suggests that these obstacles to behavioural change are more likely to represent psychological tendencies to crises rather than responses tied to a specific crisis. However, the belief that change is unnecessary varied significantly between crises. Such a perception can be difficult to overcome, but it can be done with the help of targeted strategies, such as the spread of credible information that is useful and tailored to all groups. These interventions can serve as an initiator for meaningful behavioural change.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Hessels, L.C.",September 2025,English,"No

This study explores the use of Clair, an AI-driven conversational agent, to scaffold online peer discussions via Academically Productive Talk–based “talk moves.” Eighteen dyads (N= 36) completed two structured debate tasks, first without Clair, then with Clair’s interventions. Transcripts were coded according to Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy for lower-order (remembering, understanding, applying) and higher-order (analyzing, evaluating, creating) thinking, and participants rated Clair’s prompts on focus, flow, contribution, and motivation. Results indicated that Clair increased analytical moves and that elaboration and linking prompts most effectively elicited higher-order reasoning. Questionnaire reliability was moderate (α = .56), and perceived responsiveness was mixed, with no reliable associations between prompt frequency and acceptance.

This study aimed to design and evaluate a 3D-printed siliconecardiac phantom capable of generating dynamic pressure and volume changes for use in MRIvalidation.Starting from a previous phantom design with limited contractility, a new model was developedusing iterative design, flow simulation, and 3D printing. The phantom was integratedinto a pressure chamber and actuated using the ViVitro SuperPump. Pressure was measuredvia catheter in the vena cava, while volume was assessed through both water displacement andcardiac MRI (CMR).The phantom successfully produced repeatable pressure loops, though peak values exceededphysiological norms (e.g., 187 mmHg systolic, –21 mmHg diastolic). Water-based volume outputreached approximately 85% of the pump input. MRI cine imaging confirmed visible contraction,and manual segmentation revealed clear volume differences between systole and diastole.Despite limitations such as minor leakage and manual measurement error, the phantomdemonstrated durability, anatomical accuracy, and functional deformation. The results indicatethat a silicone-based dynamic phantom is a feasible tool for simulating cardiac mechanicsand may support the validation of synchronized PV loop measurement techniques in MRI environments.1 Bachelor Biomedical Engineering (B-BMT) UT research group(s)",,"Bakker, P.",June 2025,English,"No

108632,Teams (dis)connected: The Influence of Technological Literacy on Team Cohesion and Effectiveness,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108632,"Objectives:With many professional fields making use of the opportunity of working remotely, different approaches to enabling virtual communication and collaboration have emerged. Since most organizations have started to facilitate remote work since 2020, many advantages, but also challenges have emerged. One of those challenges is the employees’ varying digital competencies pose challenges for effective teamwork. The central research question was:How does technological literacy affect team cohesion and team effectiveness in virtual worksettings? Methods:A mixed methods approach was used, combining both quantitative and qualitative data to answer the research question. Quantitatively, a questionnaire (N = 86) assessed technological literacy, team cohesion, team effectiveness, and organizational support using validated Likert-scale instruments. Data was analyzed in R using linear regression, ANOVA, and structural equation modelling. For the qualitative section, ten interviews were conducted, ranging from 38 minutes to 140 minutes, using a semi-structured interview guide. The interviews were analyzed thematically, using Atlas.ti. Results:Quantitative findings showed that technological literacy significantly predicted both team cohesion (β = 0.51,p< .001) and team effectiveness (β = 0.58,p< .001). Mediation analysis further revealed that team cohesion partially mediated the effect of technological literacy on team effectiveness. The qualitative findings allowed for further insight to explain the influence of different levels of technological literacy on topics such as task distribution, deadline setting, and general collaboration. Conclusion and practical implications: These results suggest that technological literacy is a key factor in virtual team functioning. Organizations are advised to implement structured, mandatory digital skill training, preferably during onboarding and in person, to ensure a common level of technological literacy and foster cohesive, high-performing teams.

This research investigated whether integrating multispectral satellite imagery and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with high-resolution RGB imagery could enhance automated illegal waste detection, quantification, and classification capabilities for PERIOPSIS, a technology company providing satellite-based environmental monitoring services. The study utilized 905 RGB patches from Cyprus provided by PERIOPSIS, 8-band PlanetScope multispectral imagery, and 3-band Sentinel-1 SAR data. Detection models employed encoder-decoder architectures with multi-scale Squeeze-and-Excitation fusion mechanisms. Volume quantification used SAR interferometry for Digital Elevation Model generation, while material classification applied ratio-based unsupervised clustering. Multi-modal integration achieved substantial improvements over RGB-only detection, with conditional multispectral processing reaching 15\% IoU improvement (0.614 vs 0.535 baseline) and balanced precision (0.737) and recall (0.787). SAR integration showed comparable performance under conditional processing. Quantification experiments demonstrated methodology feasibility but revealed DEM quality limitations preventing reliable volume estimation. Classification successfully distinguished four waste material categories through spectral discrimination.

108629,The Role of Resilience and Social Support in Moderating the Effect of COVID-specific Study Worries on Mental Well-Being,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108629,"The COVID-19 pandemic was a highly stressful crisis for the global population. University students in particular were faced with uncertainty and worry about their academic experience and future success, especially about their ability to be successful in their studies and find a job. Study-related worries have been shown to be negatively associated with mental well- being. However, resilience and social support have been shown to protect mental well-being against the negative effects of general worries. This study examined the effect of COVID- specific study worries on well-being and the moderating role of resilience and social support in this relationship. COVID-specific study worries included worries about academic success and financial struggles due to the COVID-19 pandemic. First and second year students from two Dutch universities answered an online questionnaire comprised of different measures. COVID-specific study worries and, unexpectedly, resilience were negatively associated with well-being whereas social support was positively associated with well-being. Resilience and social support did not moderate the relationship between COVID-specific study worries and well-being. COVID-specific study worries are important to consider when designing mental health initiatives for students during ongoing crises. Consistent with previous findings, social support was shown to be a crucial factor when aiming to improve mental well-being in university students. This study’s finding on resilience are unexpected but in line with a growing body of literature advocating for a nuanced look at the processes of resilience in dealing with adversity and if resilience is always appropriate. It calls for a shift in perspective on how classic definitions of resilience are studied in psychological literature.

108628,The assessment process of pressured sewers in dikes,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108628,"This bachelor thesis looks into the assessment of pressured sewer pipelines located within dike reinforcement zones. The thesis focusses on both the risks from these pressured pipelines and their evaluation under current Dutch standards. Also some interventions are proposed so rejected pipes do not always have to be replaced. The research is centered on the dike reinforcement project Veilige Vecht Dalfsen and was conducted at an internship at consulting engineering firm Haskoning.The NEN 3650 series (specifically NEN 3650-1, NEN 3650-3, and NEN 3651) is the set of norms that describes the criteria for pressured pipes going through dikes. However the criteria for the assessment need to be gathered from different sections of all these norms. This makes the assessment very difficult to execute for engineers that are not acquainted with the norms. To make the assessment simpler, this thesis has brought all the criteria and calculation methods into one assessment method. This gives an overview of all the steps that need to be taken in order to do a full assessment of a pipe. The thesis states that it must first be determined whether the pipe is actually inside the safety zone of the dike. This is done by determining the orientation and the size of the erosion crater. When the pipe is inside the erosion zone it should be checked if it is strong enough in seven aspects: inner pressure, loads, tensions, relative strength, minimal ring stiffness, implosion chance and deflection. When these aspects are all approved it can be concluded that the pipe is strong enough. The strength is, however, not the only thing that needs to be tested. The assessment also includes the check if a sheet pile construction is needed, if there are no valves inside the safety zone, if the pipe couplings are correct and if there is enough ground coverage above the crown of the pipe.After the assessment method is constructed, some alternatives are discussed that could help a rejected pipe to be ‘’rescued’’ and prevent replacement. The placement of sheet pile constructions is an intervention to decrease erosion crater impact that is already included in the norms. There are other interventions that could also help to decrease erosion crater risk. Interventions like the enhancement of the surrounding soil to be more erosion proof and the placement of valves are proposed. To be able to implement these interventions, the effect of soil type should be included in the erosion crater calculations and the use of valves should be stated more clearly in the norms.After the interventions are determined, it is examined if the assessment process can be simplified. The process can be made easier for engineers by making a calculation tool that directly gives an assessment when the data is filled in. The thesis also proposes the idea of conducting a sensitivity analysis to see which data is important to know very precisely and which data could be estimated.The thesis concludes that while the existing standards provide a solid foundation for ensuring dike safety, they are often impractical in day-to-day engineering practice. The proposed assessment method offers a more efficient way of assessing pressured sewer pipes in dike zones, especially under conditions of limited data. As the NEN 3650/3651 standards are expected to be revised in 2025, this thesis provides timely recommendations to enhance regulatory flexibility and support more balanced, risk-informed infrastructure decision-making.

108625,Development of a quantitative knee laxity medical tester for clinical evaluation,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108625,"Of the sports injuries 3,5% are injuries to the medial collateral ligament (MCL) or the lateral collateral ligament (LCL). The clinical grade of the injury is determined by evaluating the laxity of the ligament. Subsequently, the treatment of the injury is then based on the clinical grade. Currently the laxity of the MCL is assessed by a valgus stress test, and the laxity of the LCL is assessed by a varus stress test. The valgus stress test has an 87% accuracy for determining the presence of an MCL injury, but there is only a 65% accuracy in determining the clinical grade of the injury. Therefore, a new medical device (called the Laxmeter) is designed to objectively measure the stiffness/ laxity of the MCL and LCL for two purposes:1)Measuring precisely and reliably the state of the laxity.2)Performing accurate longitudinal monitoring of the rehabilitation of athletes, such that the possible loads and exercises for the athlete can be offered optimally.The Laxmeter is placed on the knee and lower leg of the patient during a varus or valgus stress test. During the stress test the Laxmeter measures three things: the varus/ valgus angle at the knee, the force exerted at the ankle, and the length between the angle sensor and the load cell. The Laxmeter automatically calculates the stiffness of the ligaments using the measured parameters and shows the value on a display. Having demonstrated proof of principle with a sensory system validation, the usability of the Laxmeter was evaluated with an end-user test. First, physicians were asked pre-test questions to evaluate the intuitiveness of the Laxmeter. Next, they placed the Laxmeter and executed a varus and a valgus stress test both at 0° and at 20°-30° knee flexion. Finally, the physicians filled in the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) and a questionnaire (Likert scale 1-5). The results of the NASA TLX are given from 0% (very low) to 100% (very high). The overall min-med-max of the NASA TLX is 10%-35%-80%. The best scoring element is the mental demand with a min-med-max of 10%-30%-60%. The best scoring question in the questionnaire is: When using the product, I experience physical discomfort. Scoring a min-med max of 4-5-5 (5 being very little). The worst scoring question of the questionnaire is: Performing an action with this product leads to a predictable result. Scoring a min-med-max of 1-3-4 (1 being very little, 5 being very much). The results show that the Laxmeter is easy to understand and comfortable for physicians. The results of the sensory system validation showed that the accuracy of the Laxmeter is 0,11 N/mm, and the precision (standard deviation) is 0,13 N/mm. The reliability seen in the technical validation did not show in the end-user test. This needs to be improved in the next iteration of the Laxmeter. The sensory system validation and the positive reactions of the physicians show that the development of the Laxmeter should continue, by implementing the improvement points found in this thesis.

108622,Microplastics in the news: A media content analysis of Dutch newspaper' coverage of microplastics,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108622,"Aim:Media reporting on microplastics has surged in recent years, especially following the discovery of plastic particles in the human body, which received widespread media attention.This study investigates how Dutch newspapers have framed microplastics between 2004 and 2025, focusing on the use of environmental and human health frames, as well as variations in tone of voice, inclusion of sources, and risk presentation. Method:A qualitative media analysis was conducted on 467 articles from four major Dutch newspapers to assess the presence of different news frames overtime, followed by an in-depth content analysis on 45 articles to compare different news frames. Results:Findings show that the environmental frame dominated coverage overall, but in recent years there is a rise in media reporting of microplastics in relation to human health. Articles using the human health frame more frequently portrayed the potential effects of microplastics as likely and harmful, whereas those using the environmental frame tended to emphasize scientific uncertainty. Overall, the tone of reporting was neutral, and most articles substantiated their claims with references to scientific sources. Conclusion:The study shows a shift in Dutch newspapers from an environmental focus to a more multifaceted portrayal of microplastics that includes health concerns. While reporting is largely balanced, health-related narratives appear to carry more urgency, potentially influencing public perception and policy support.

108621,Agentic AI in dike design,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108621,"Over the past few decades, dike design has evolved from a technical discipline into a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates various social and environmental aspects. Additionally, the requirements for dikes have changed as they have shifted from being flood probability-based to flood risk-based. The new approach has complicated the calculations and overall process of dike design, leading to long design processes which span several years. This is an expensive process that requires extensive calculations, stakeholder participation, and numerous permits. Automation is required to improve the efficiency of this process. Since AI represents a paradigm shift in automation applications, this study aims to explore the application of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) in dike design by developing a proof-of-concept system that designs a dike with a focus on macro-stability and stakeholder integration. This Agentic AI aims to replicate the decision-making process in dike design and independently design a dike. The central research question of this study is: ”What is the added value of agentic AI in automating and optimising dike design, with regard to efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility?” To address this question, the research is structured around three subquestions focusing on: 1. The structure of the system architecture. 2. The design and functioning of individual agents. 3. The evaluation of the developed model. Agentic AI refers to systems in which multiple specialised agents collaborate to perform complex tasks. These agents are typically powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to interpret inputs and generate suitable outputs. Some agents are equipped with specialised tools for specific operations, while others rely on extensive contextual information embedded in their prompts. The architecture of the agentic AI system consists of four agents. The stakeholder agent identifies and ranks stakeholders while simultaneously setting demand for the dike design. The other three agents together form a design loop with a supervisor agent that determines the flow of the design loop, a dike design agent that assigns dimensions and assesses macro-stability, and a demand-check agent that verifies the design against the system’s set demands. The stakeholder agent and the dike design agent are built on established theories, and the dike design agent utilises a metamodel for macro-stability assessment. The model evaluation utilises Covello & Merkhofer’s risk assessment framework to evaluate the model; this framework assesses six criteria, and one is added for this specific model. The extra aspect is flexibility. Methods to assess the model of these criteria include an expert elicitation, analyses of the model’s results, and comparing a design from the model to an actual dike, in this case, the Grebbedijk. The model scores well in terms of flexibility, completeness, practicality, and effectiveness. Average on accuracy and acceptability, and low on logical soundness, which includes transparency and consistency. Transparency is a common issue for AI systems due to the complexity of their internal processes. Since the model relies on an LLM, the quality of the results depends on the LLM; when the LLM is inconsistent in its results, the model also becomes inconsistent. This is the biggest flaw in the model. Based on the current study, it is recommended to continue developing Agentic AI by researching the performance of various LLMs, LLM settings, and different structures, such as an agentic workflow, rather than an agentic AI system. These factors have a significant impact on the performance of such models. Agentic AI systems are beneficial in the initial design phase of projects due to their time efficiency, but are limited in consistency and therefore in actual decision-making.

108620,IoC to TTP & Identifying Malware Attack Techniques in Cyber Threat Intelligence,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108620,"With united efforts, malware taxonomy and threat behavior has become a well-documented sphere, labeled as Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). CTIs are a useful resource within the cybersecurity field, as these reports delve into observed real-life threats and their respective tools. An expert can translate a malware’s plan of action into distinct tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) for a more structured overview of its attack path, as well as extract Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to fingerprint the malware. While IoCs are commonly found in CTIs, TTPs are harder to come by, despite their relation to each other for describing a scenario. We assess to what extent it is possible to link IoCs and TTPs, to formulate more context from CTIs. This paper compares performance of the state of the art tool TRAM at identifying techniques from descriptive malware summaries and CTIs. Additionally, we evaluate the model performance on the sentences mentioning IoCs, to understand the relationbetween IoCs and TTPs. As we discover from our results, TTP classification in malware CTI is possible. However, natural text induces false positives as not all sentences give context to a malware family; for this reason, experiments which performed preliminary sentence filtering performed better. Filtering for TTP context with sentences referencing IoCs results in an increase in average area under receiver-operating characteristic (AUC) of 10%. As the relationship between IoCs and TTPs is still to be explored and utilized, we propose future implementations that can aid in a better utilization and understanding of the  elation between IoCs and TTPs.

108619,Transformation of Digital Twin SysML v1.6 models to SysML v2.0,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108619,"SysML v1.6 has been widely adopted as a modelling language utilized across various fields, including manufacturing, automotive, and aerospace engineering, due to its ability to represent complex systems in a structured manner. Its applicability also extends to the Digital Twins, which mainly facilitate real-time simulations and decision-making capabilities in cyber-physical environments. With the development of a newer version of SysML v2.0, which brings improved semantic precision and interoperability, version migration becomes increasingly relevant. Although SysML v2.0 is still in development, its adoption is expected to grow as companies start to seek ways to leverage the capabilities of this newer version. As a consequence, the question of migration of legacy models is also addressed. This Master project utilizes a Design Science Research methodology and implements a model-driven transformation approach to perform the transformation of SysML v1.6 Block Definition Diagrams to SysML v2.0 textual models. Using Eclipse Modeling Framework tools including Papyrus, QVTo, and Acceleo, the study defines conceptual mappings and a two-phase transformation chain that first converts SysML v1.6 models to a simplified intermediate model, then generates SysML v2.0 textual syntax. Validation on 12 academically used Digital Twin models shows that the transformation completely preserves the elements defined in the original models, with minor deviations in terms of structure in specific cases. The research demonstrates the feasibility and extensibility of SysML version migration and provides a foundation for future enhancements towards broader diagram support, improved tooling, and streamlined migration across SysML versions.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Koryugin, D.",August 2025,English,"No

108616,Exploring AI-Driven Customer Discovery: A Case Study Using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation Agent,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108616,"This study explores how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology can support early-stage customer discovery for research-intensive startups, with a focus on wearm.ai, a company developing wearable sports technology. In such industries, startups often face significant challenges identifying potential customers due to limited resources, fragmented market signals, and a lack of historical customer data. Traditional methods like expert interviews, surveys, and online searches are time-consuming and lack scalability, making them less suitable for the fast-paced iteration required in early product development. RAG systems, which combine semantic retrieval and natural language generation, offer a promising alternative by extracting insights from large-scale open-access scientific literature. These systems enable the identification of research communities aligned with a startup’s focus and generate contextually relevant responses to natural language queries, making them particularly effective when the market is still undefined. To address the limitations of conventional customer discovery approaches, this research builds a RAG-based AI agent capable of semantically identifying and ranking potential research users. The thesis employs a case study methodology guided by the CRISP-DM process, covering business understanding, data preparation, modeling and evaluation stages. Data is collected from three years of abstracts from five international biomechanics conferences and supplemented with Scopus metadata. Using semantic embeddings from SciBERT and all-MiniLM-L6-v2 models, Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for visualization, the system reveals research topic structures and researcher profiles. The RAG agent allows users to explore the academic landscape through natural language queries. It integrates clustering results, author citation metrics, research funding data, and semantic relevance to generate ranked recommendations. Model evaluation includes expert feedback, semantic consistency analysis, and clustering quality measures such as Silhouette scores, ensuring practical usability and interpretability. Findings from the case study show that the RAG system effectively identifies semantically relevant potential clients from public academic sources without requiring prior customer relationships. It enables efficient exploration of research communities by linking literature clusters to author profiles and supporting customer discovery in specific thematic areas. Experts confirm the tool’s practical value and its ability to inform market validation and product strategy. This research contributes to both theory and practice by extending the application of RAG technology to customer discovery in cold-start contexts. It proposes a modular workflow that combines open semantic data, document clustering, and natural language generation, offering a transferable framework for AI-supported market exploration. The results demonstrate that this approach enhances early customer identification for startups operating in research-intensive, resource-constrained environments. This modular framework may be extended to other B2B or academic-driven technology sectors.",Master Business Information Technology (M-BIT),"Li, Y.",August 2025,English,"No

108615,Blink and You Miss It: Exploring Event-Related Blinks in a Purpose-Designed Simulated High-Performance Flight Environment,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108615,"This thesis examines whether the timing of eye blinks indexes information intake during a complex flight-simulation task. When blinks are time-locked to external events, they are termed event-related blinks (ERBs). A multitask flight simulation combined continuous altitude control, auditory call sign monitoring, and rare visual threat alerts. Six participants contributed data: five completed sixteen four-minute blocks and one completed twelve; blocks alternated between low and high workload. Blinks were extracted from frontal EEG using an envelope detector with an ICA fallback and were qualitatively checked against eye-tracking. Tonic blink rate averaged 8.5 blinks/min and did not vary with workload. By contrast, blink timing was event-coupled. In post-offset windows, blink probability exceeded a Poisson baseline (call sign targets: z = 2.66; enemy cues: z = 2.81); during the spoken call sign (onset window), the excess was modest (significant for non-targets; marginal for targets). In the pre-specified window after call sign offset, blink probability was higher on target than on non-target trials (odds ratio = 1.12, 95% CI [1.05, 1.18]). The results indicate that ERB timing could provide a measurable, low-latency cue of successful information intake in dense multitasking, whereas rate alone does not. Given the small sample size, precision is limited. Further validation with a larger sample and in more ecological settings is required. ERB timing may be considered for integration into multimodal online monitors of pilot workload and cue intake.",Master Interaction Technology (M-ITECH),"Sabermanesh, A.",August 2025,English,"No.

Traditional exploration methods struggle with performance and higher computational costs, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers better performance but suffers from instability and struggles with convergence. This thesis proposes a hybrid approach that integrates Behavior Cloning (BC), a form of Imitation Learning (IL), with the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) DRL algorithm for continuous control to improve UAV exploration performance, robustness, and generalization.The designed method begins by collecting expert trajectories and using them to pretrain a policy with IL. The pretrained policy is then fine-tuned with DRL in a photorealistic indoor environment in NVIDIA Isaac Sim. The state given to the algorithm includes semantic visual inputs with depth perception to enhance situational awareness.Experiments show that the pretrained IL policy with DRL converges faster and achieves higher coverage and success rates compared to baselines trained purely with DRL or IL. The results also show that incorporating semantic visual inputs enhances exploration performance by providing structured high-level environmental information. In conclusion, this thesis shows the benefits of combining IL with RL in complex, unknown indoor environments, laying the foundation for deploying autonomous UAVs in mission-critical scenarios.

Two of these configurations have parallel current paths in the rectification side of the converter, which can lead to current imbalance between phases. This thesis investigates possible methods of mitigating the current imbalance within the converter. First, a literature review is conducted to understand resonant converter operation and determine the best potential routes for current balancing from existing scientific literature. This involves analyzing methodologies to determine their compatibility with the converter on hand. The three best solutions are then studied and tested on the converter in simulation and practically to determine their effectiveness. This involves developing custom current balancing solutions for the converter and conducting experimental analysis to observe their effectiveness on the converter. The results from this analysis are used to determine the feasibility and options of current balancing solutions for the marine converter in practical operation.

These vulnerabilities might causemany security breaches, ranging from remote code executionand privilege escalation to the leakage of sensitive information.Existing security tools and practices often require a significantamount of manual effort or static analysis, and often rely on exist-ing predefined databases. This increases the need for automated,intelligence-driven offensive security testing tailored specificallyto container security. In the past couple of years, researchershave started exploring Large language models (LLMs) as away to improve security testing. Many experiments have shownpromising results that LLMs can potentially help in identifyingvulnerabilities and increasing system defenses. However, most ofthe current LLM-based methods fall short when it comes to fullyautomating offensive pentesting, which is essential for uncoveringDocker-specific risks. This gap is an immediate requirement tofill as new Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) arepiling up faster than the patches.To address this, we propose a fully automated multi-agentframework, Multiagent-Vuln-Assist (MVA), for evaluating LLMcapabilities in terms of container security. Unlike traditionalapproaches, our research introduces a multi-agent LLM systemwith a leader-follower architecture, integrated with a customKali Linux image equipped with open-source risk analysis tools.The framework evaluated the performance of the different LLMmodels on multiple vulnerable containers that potentially lead toRemote Code Execution (RCE).

The study responds to growing concerns about misinformation, language barrier, and cultural disconnection in digital news consumption by focusing on a user group that remains underrepresented in research. Guided by the heuristic systematic model of creditability assessment, Berry’s acculturation framework, and cultural proximity theory, this study examines the interplay between language proficiency, media literacy, and cultural background in shaping users ‘trust perceptions. A qualitative design was complied, combining semi-structured interviews, think- aloud observations of TikTok news content, and a short survey used solely for participant profiling. Data were analyzed through inductive thematic coding, tracing the cures and strategies users relied on to evaluate Dutch language News content. Findings show that participants used both heuristics shortcuts (e.g., visual quality, source logos, engagement metrics) and more deliberate strategies (e.g., fact-checking, subtitle inspection, cross-platform comparisons) to judge credibility. Language proficiency acts as a gateway: limited Dutch knowledge often led to disengagement or reliance on English sources, while higher proficiency enabled deeper critical engagement. Media literacy further influenced how participants questioned the content, with more literate users applying layered verification strategies. Cultural proximity and integration orientation shaped interest and interpretive lenses, influencing which topics resonated and how messages were interpreted. This study contributes to the understanding of trust information in short-form, algorithmic news environments and highlights the complex ways in which digital engagement is filtered through linguistic and cultural experiences.

108607,The redesign of an adjustable offloading ankle orthosis for ankle joint rehabilitation,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108607,"Osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs) are common ankle injuries. They often occur in young, active patients following traumatic sports injuries. OLTs have a multi-week rehabilitation period that often includes progressive partial weightbearing. The assistive devices currently used during this period lack precise offloading control, limit ankle mobility and can inhibit daily life. This study presents the redesign of a unilateral, adjustable offloading ankle foot orthosis to support this rehabilitation. This design uses a compression spring mechanism which is adjustable by reducing the number of coils used to allow for adjustable offloading between 25% and 50% of bodyweight. Conceptual designs were developed by iterating through sketching, quasi static load cases and Solidworks simulations. The final design has a curved ground contact part which allows the offloading to follow the natural shape of the ankle joint reaction force and minimizes the interference with the normal gait cycle. A first prototype was produced to test this design. A technical validation was conducted using the Zwick Z100 which showed positive results regarding the strength of the prototype and no failures occurred. This allowed a subject test to be performed as a proof of concept whereby one subject was tested using the emed® q pedography platform. During this subject test the offloading reached between 38% and 52% during the first 85% of the stance phase. During the last 15% of the stance phase, the ground contact part did not touch the ground anymore.

This has put pressure on traditional Search Engine Optimization (SEO) models, with potential consequences for the online findability and marketing strategies within Achmea, the case study organization for this research. This study aims to provide insight into how Achmea is responding to the transition from traditional search engines to AI-driven search models. It examines adoption processes within the organization, changing user search behavior, and strategic implications for content optimization. Method:Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with internal professionals from various Achmea brands and external SEO and AI experts. The data were thematically coded and analyzed based on four content clusters. Results:The results indicate that the development of AI-driven search technology, through its interpretation and promotion of zero-click behavior among users, will disrupt traditional search engines and current SEO strategies. AI-driven search behavior, where users require less effort in their search queries, suggests that customer contact and brand loyalty may decline. Within Achmea, some brands and departments are already in the early research stages in response to the emergence and use of AI search, while others are taking a cautious approach due to internal complexity and a risk-averse culture. To remain visible in this new search environment, current content strategies must change and no longer produce only human-centric content, but also AI-optimized formats that prioritize semantics, entity coverage, and the credibility of brand content. Conclusion:AI search engines are not an extension of traditional search models, but form an independent ecosystem that requires a new strategic approach. Organizations are advised to set up central coordination on AI, actively optimize content for AI models, and measure new forms of visibility that go beyond traditional web traffic statistics.

108597,"Integrating Environmental variable for Enhanced Cross-Regional Maize Crop Time Series Classification: A Case Study of Nyagatare, Rwanda",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108597,"Accurate and timely crop classification is crucial for agricultural monitoring and informed decision-making, especially in regions with limited access to ground-truth data. Sub-Saharan regions, including areas like Nyagatare District in Rwanda, face two major challenges in remote sensing-based crop mapping: data scarcity and temporal shift. Data scarcity refers to the lack of labeled samples needed to train machine learning models, while temporal shift arises due to differences in climate, crop calendars, and agricultural practices across regions, which leads to misaligned crop development timelines and reduced model accuracy. These limitations hinder the ability to develop reliable classification models using conventional supervised learning approaches.This study addresses both challenges by introducing a transferable maize classification method that leverages environmental similarities specifically temperature and precipitation between Europe (2018) and Rwanda (2020). The research aims to develop and evaluate a Random Forest classification model trained on environmentally matched European regions and applied to Nyagatare District. The main objective is supported by three sub-objectives: (i) to generate representative training samples from European croplands with climate conditions similar to Nyagatare; (ii) to train and optimize a Random Forest classifier using these samples; and (iii) to evaluate the model’s performance using a leave-one-region-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) strategy and apply it to the Nyagatare context.Seven regions across France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom were selected based on annual temperature (18–24°C) and precipitation (864–1474 mm) thresholds to reflect Nyagatare’s environmental conditions. Sentinel-2 imagery for 2018 (Europe) and 2020 (Nyagatare) was used, from which 368 spectral-temporal features were extracted using vegetation indices NDVI, EVI, SAVI, and NDWI and a sliding-window approach to capture phenological variability. A two-stage evaluation was implemented. First, leave-one-region-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) was used to assess the model’s generalizability across the European regions and identify the optimal hyperparameters. Then, the model was re-trained using the best-performing configuration and the complete training data from all four countries, and subsequently applied to Nyagatare.The results demonstrated robust model performance. The best LOO-CV fold achieved 88.0% accuracy, 92.0% recall, and an F1 score of 87.0%. When applied to Nyagatare, the model yielded 83.8% accuracy, 85.0% precision, 84.0% recall, and an F1 score of 84.0%. Feature importance analysis showed that sliding-window vegetation indices contributed most to prediction accuracy, confirming the value of capturing temporal dynamics. NDVI trend comparisons between Nyagatare and European farms confirmed phenological alignment, validating the environmental matching strategy.Despite its effectiveness, the study acknowledges limitations such as the use of only temperature and precipitation for matching, exclusion of other agronomic factors (e.g., soil type, crop variety, soil moisture), reliance on single-year data, and unresolved temporal misalignments. Nonetheless, the findings challenge the traditional emphasis on geographic proximity for transfer learning and suggest that environmental similarity offers a powerful alternative. This research contributes a scalable, cost-effective framework for crop mapping in data-scarce environments and supports global agricultural monitoring efforts aligned with Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). Future research should explore multi-year and multi-source datasets, Sentinel-1 SAR integration, employing metamodel approaches to combine predictions from different models, and explainable AI methods such as SHAP or LIME to improve interpretability and robustness.

108594,Enhancing VerCors's User Interface Experience: Integrating Language Server Protocol for Improved Usability,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108594,"Usability plays a crucial role in the effectiveness and adoption of formal verification tools, which enable developers to prove that programs meet their specifications. This project aims to improve the usability of the VerCors formal verification tool for parallel and concurrent programs by integrating Language Server Protocol(LSP) support into it. VerCors command-line interface poses usability challenges because it lacks modern IDE features such as in-editor diagnostics, autocompletion, and navigation. However, the integration of LSP support in VerCors enables to work directly in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and use these features, which simplifies and speeds up the process of writing program specifications. This project includes an analysis of LSP implementations in verification tools such as Dafny, Viper, and Caesar, collecting insights from these tools to develop an embedded LSP server within VerCors. This integration enables diagnostics, go-to definition, progress reporting, autocompletion, and real-time verification tracking features in VS Code. In addition, this thesis investigates the limitations of the previous design project while reusing its valuable developments. The developed LSP integration is evaluated on representative Java and PVL programs, validating the correctness of implemented features through manual testing. This work lays the foundation for further integration of LSP into VerCors, providing a basis for improving the features developed in this project and introducing new ones to expand IDE support for VerCors in the future.

This study examined caregiver–child agreement on ICD-11 PGD symptoms and whether disagreement was related to PGD severity in either informant or caregiver gender. 84 bereaved caregiver–child dyads (children aged 8–18, 61.9% female) completed self- and proxy-reports of PGD symptoms (TGI-K-CA, TGI-K-CR, TGI-SR+). Bland–Altman analyses, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and weighted Cohen’s κ were used to assess agreement. Regression models tested whether PGD severity and caregiver gender predicted absolute and directional disagreement. Results showed moderate overall agreement (ICC= .59). Higher child PGD severity was linked to caregiver underreporting, while greater caregiver PGD severity was associated with overreporting. Caregiver gender alone was not associated with disagreement; however, male caregivers with elevated PGD symptoms exhibited greater disagreement, particularly underreporting child symptoms. These findings underscore the need for multi-informant assessments, as caregiver reports may not reliably reflect children’s grief when caregivers themselves are highly distressed.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Tebarth, M.O.",August 2025,English,"No.

108588,Explainable Machine Learning  for Quantifying and Improving  Cybersecurity Posture in SMEs,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108588,"With cyber threats increasing in frequency and cost, many organisations remain unprepared to assess or improve their cybersecurity posture. Especially for small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs), who often lack resources or awareness, scalable and automated solutions are urgently needed. This research explores the use of explainable machine learning (XAI) to assess and enhance cybersecurity posture using internal and externally visible security features.First, we investigate whether internal cybersecurity features (accessible only from within the network) can be inferred solely from externally collected data (e.g. network scans).Clustering and classification models are trained using these external features to determine internal configurations. Results show limited success, indicating that internal features provide distinct, non-redundant information about the security posture. Because of this, the subsequent two steps are performed using both external and internal features. Second, we assess whether a ML model’s certainty of an enterprise being classifiedas likely to experience an incident can be used as a quantified measure of cybersecurity posture. Using historical incident data from over 400 SMEs, the best model (a Random Forest with class-weight adjustments) achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.77. While leaving room for improvement, the resulting scoring offers a scalable, data-driven alternative to expert-derived posture assessments.Third, we apply SHAP to generate both global and local explanations of model predictions. These insights reveal key features influencing incident risk and support using personalized recommendations for posture improvement.Our results demonstrate that while internal features are difficult to infer from only external data, (explainable) ML methods are effective for quantifying and explaining cybersecurity posture, and for providing SME-specific, actionable recommendations.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"den Hartog, D.",August 2025,English,"No

It brings together philosophy of science and epistemology on the one hand, and a social science inspired methodology on the other. The thesis was built on a theoretical foundation of standpoint epistemology and ontological plurality, and considered the issues of incommensurability and epistemic justice to guide inquiry. The main theoretical research interest lay in how pluralistic approaches can help to better steer scientific research. The primary empirical research question was concerned with the ontologies and the values represented by international students and staff at the University of Twente, who self-identify as coming from a non-Western background. A small scale exploratory study was conducted to collect empirical data, in the form of an anonymous online questionnaire and a set of semi-structured interviews. This data was then analysed using a combination of elements from hermeneutic phenomenological analysis and structural narrative analysis, and presented as a set of interpretive narrative reconstructions. The main conclusions of the study and the project point to the existence of a rich multiplicity in beliefs about the world and the ways in which we can come to know it, a distinct focus on the importance of non-epistemic values in scientific practice, and the deep, troubling scars of colonialism which continue to ooze to this very day.","Master Philosophy of Science, Technology and Society (M-PSTS)","Bors, C.A.",August 2025,English,"No.

Many studies before have proven the existence of such arcs on a story as a whole, but this has not often been done for the characters within a story. In this project, the emotional arcs of specific characters within works of fiction were detected and evaluated. This was done by looking at sentiment values of text segments, and plotting these sentiment values against the point of the book at which their occur (percentage). A ground truth was determined by asking participants to annotate parts of a story with sentiment scores, and the sentiments arcs (character- or story-wide) were compared to this ground truth plot. To achieve this, NER and coreference resolution were applied first to identify characters in the story, then the text was segmented into pieces in which a character was present, after which the sentiment was calculated over the selected text fragments for specific characters. Different types of sentiment models (lexicon-based, vector-space, SVM, transformers) were tested. Findings show that with this process none of the models gets a very close match to the ground truth, though transformers seem to generally perform the best with the current method for most stories. Overall, character arcs can be plotted to a certain degree, but the current method proves to be flawed in accurately determining the correct emotional arc on a character basis.",Master Interaction Technology (M-ITECH),"Brugman, D.S.",August 2025,English,"No.

108585,Improving Radiation Tolerance for Neuromorphic Processors,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108585,"This thesis investigated the radiation tolerance of neuromorphic architectures. This was triggered by the findings from the existing literature that neuromorphic architectures have good radiation tolerance. To improve on this radiation tolerance, we introduced online learning, an Spike-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity (SDSP) learning mechanism that runs unsupervised on the system and has the task of counteracting radiation influences. To validate our approach, we needed to expose our architecture to radiation. To make a test target for this, we needed an FPGA, for which we selected a flash-based FPGA. The device we picked was the PolarFire® SoC FPGA Icicle Kit. We also had to choose an open-source neuromorphic architecture to place on that FPGA; for this, we did a design space exploration and selected the Online-learning Digital spiking Neuromorphic processor (ODIN) architecture due to its learning capabilities and its relatively small size. We then created monitoring logic around the neuromorphic implementation and created a test setup. We also had to train the neuromorphic architecture and configure the online learning parameters. We selected the MNIST dataset for training. The task of the neuromorphic architecture was to classify those images. The initial model training was done with Python, the resulting weights of this training were put on the FPGA and that gave us the starting point for radiation testing. We created a UART connection to the FPGA to configure the architecture, set up the weights, and also to send the images and retrieve the classification output. With our neuromorphic architecture setup on the FPGA device, we were able to test the architecture against radiation. We started with radiation beam testing at the ChipIR testing facility at Appleton Laboratory in the UK. This radiation beam allowed us to collect data about the radiation resistance of our system. We expanded the data collection by running a simulation based on the measured fault rate to get more information on radiation effects over a longer time period. The ODIN architecture showed good radiation resistance without additional learning, but with added learning, the accuracy in the shorter runs decreased instead of increased. We ran additional simulations and found that over a longer period of time learning will have positive effects. We ran simulations until we had a completely failed system without learning. We did not see complete system failure with learning enabled, so this means that learning increases the time it will take for the system to completely fail by at least 175%. Therefore, while learning does not significantly contribute to preserving the system’s initial high level of accuracy against radiation effects, it is highly effective in substantially delaying the complete failure of the system.

Drawing on literature from philosophy of technology, public administration, and gender studies, it builds a robust theoretical background that demonstrates the influence spaces have on queer gender expression, as well as the lack of discussion surrounding non-binary individuals in relation to spatiality. This theoretical foundation additionally highlights the need for non-binary inclusion in policy and spaces, as well as examining academic recommendations on how to embrace non-binary gender identities in both material space and cyberspace. Through an analysis of empirical data gathered from semi-structured interviews with Dutch municipal inclusivity officers, several key challenges, stakeholder reactions, and existing efforts within Dutch local governance are examined. By integrating these insights with academic suggestions, context-based recommendations are provided for Dutch municipalities to further include non-binary people in both material space, through restrooms, and cyberspace, through forms. Concerning forms, municipalities should no longer mention gender unless it can be demonstrated to be necessary. Regarding bathrooms, local governments should consider transforming gendered restrooms into all-gender bathrooms to ensure public support.

This thesis aimed to identify key functional and non-functional system requirements and assessed the agreement on system needs and challenges for secure genomic data-sharing platforms, with a specific focus on the perspectives of technical experts within this domain. A mixed-methods approach was used, combining the data of an online survey with qualitative workshop data involving multidisciplinary experts. The survey results showed broad agreement among technical experts on the importance of privacy-preserving design (M=6.50; SD=0.65; IQR=1), standardization (M=6.00; SD=1.47; IQR=1), and infrastructure models such as horizontal partitioning (M=6.79; SD=0.43; IQR=0) and federated computing, while legal experts emphasized the need for regulatory harmonization (M=5.13; SD=1.89;IQR=1.25) and compliance with the GDPR (M=6.00; SD=1.15; IQR=1.5). The workshop results complemented this, showing high consensus for the importance of data accessibility, technical scalability, standardization, and support for legal and ethical compliance. Together, the findings highlight the need for federated infrastructures that are technically robust, legally compliant, and user-centered in design.

108581,Digital Product Passports:  Reference Architecture for  IoT-enabled Electrical and  Electronic Equipment,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108581,"The increasing need for transparency, traceability, and sustainable practices in supply chains,most importantly the need transition from liner economy to circular economy, has driven thedevelopment of Digital Product Passports (DPPs). These structured digital records are designedto capture key product lifecycle data, from raw material sourcing to end-of-life management andsupport the transition to a circular economy. This thesis investigates the role of DPPs in reducinginformation asymmetry specially in the middle-of-life (MoL)/ Usage phase of IoT-enabled Electricaland Electronic Equipment (EEE), and proposes a validated reference architecture to guide theireffective implementation for which mostly DPP is still a raising topic and industry experts arefinding it difficult to understand the what exactly DPP means for them and as a whole ecosystem.This research begins with a detailed literature review of DPPs, analyzing definitions, regulatoryguidance, EU Regulation, Expert Opinions by DPP Providers, data requirements, and architectural needs. The study acknowledges that while DPPs hold significant promise, their successfulintegration into existing EEE supply chains requires both technical and organizational enablers.To address this challenge, the thesis proposes a dedicated reference architecture specifically designed for DPP integration in EEE supply chains. This architecture incorporates principles fromenterprise architecture and data mesh models, emphasizing secure data sharing, role-based accesscontrol, trust building, and modular design.The reference architecture is evaluated using a structured validation phase, involving expertfeedback through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The validation focused on threekey aspects: usefulness, quality, and variability along with business related questions section whichfocuses on business perspective. Results confirmed the model’s strength in aligning business andtechnical roles, enabling traceability, and supporting real-world implementation. However, limitations were identified since most notably the lack of inclusion of key MoL actors in the validaionprocess, like repairers and refurbishers, who are critical for making DPPs truly useful in the reuseand refurbishment stages.Additionally, the study highlights that the successful adoption of DPPs depends not only ontechnology but also on organizational readiness, governance, and collaboration within the ecosystem. Feedback from participants emphasized the need for dedicated DPP teams, simplified architectural visuals for non-technical users and a personnel who fully understands complete DPPecosystem is the key for coordinating this, and the inclusion of all lifecycle actors to ensure practical implementations. Key challenges identified include unclear regulatory guidance in the EEEsector specially, concerns about data confidentiality, and the absence of standardized data-sharingframeworks across industries.This thesis contributes to practice by delivering a validated reference architecture tailored forDPP adoption in the EEE sector. It offers a structured approach to lifecycle data management,supports ecosystem-wide collaboration, and provides a reusable framework for organizations aimingto meet circular economy targets. It also contributes to academic literature by exploring theintersection of data architecture, enterprise modeling, while demonstrating how expert validationcan be applied to architectural research.A key limitation of this research is that the reference architecture was not tested in a liveorganizational setting, leaving its practical applicability unverified. In addition, some perspectives mainly particularly those of downstream stakeholders such as repairers and refurbishers weremissing in the validation phase.Future research should aim to pilot the architecture in real-world projects, expand validationto include MoL actors like repairers and refurbishers and other downstream partners, and evaluatethe impact of DPP adoption on operational efficiency and sustainability outcomes. Updates maybe needed as regulatory frameworks evolve and best practices for DPP implementation becomemore widely established.In conclusion, the thesis offers both conceptual and potential for practical contributions, itclarifies the role and scope of DPPs in supporting circular economy goals and presents a validatedarchitectural approach for their adoption in the EEE sector. Future work should focus on extendingthe architecture to incorporate external MoL actors and testing it in real-world pilot projects toassess its scalability and impact. The research demonstrates that when implemented with the rightarchitectural and governance structures, DPPs can significantly reduce information asymmetry andenable more sustainable, data-driven supply chain practices.Keywords: Digital Product Passport (DPP), Reference Architecture, Circular Economy, Information Asymmetry, IoT, Enterprise Architecture, Middle-of-Life (MoL), Electrical and ElectronicEquipment (EEE).",Master Business Information Technology (M-BIT),"Kunapareddy, J.N.I.",August 2025,English,"No

Utilizing a dataset of over 550 million Reddit comments spanning 11 years, the study analyzes shifts in online discourse, including sentiment, toxicity, scientific and pseudoscientific interests, and community interactions. By employing natural language processing, time-series modeling, and statistical verification, this research introduces an unbiased event discovery approach that detects significant behavioral anomalies without pre-selecting events.Key findings indicate that major violent incidents, specifically mass shootings (e.g., Sandy Hook, Las Vegas, and El Paso), a pandemic (COVID-19) or an election (2016 US election), can have measurable statistical association with online political discussions. For instance, following the Sandy Hook shooting, the mean sentiment in Republican-leaning communities dropped by 25% (from 0.28 to 0.21, p < 0.001). Additionally, after the Las Vegas mass shooting, the inclusion coefficient between Republican-leaning communities and pseudoscience-related subreddits surged (p < 0.001), highlighting a potential shift toward misinformation. As behavioral values have mostly gone into unfavorable directions in the communities (lower sentiment, higher interactionswith pseudoscience), we suggest the need for higher vigilance in online political communities during times of crises.The 2016 Presidential Elections in the United States had the most change happening with it, community interactions among the two political camps increased (0.149 to 0.19, p=0.002), so did the overlap with several scientific communities while contribution patterns also showed anomalic values. The increased openness with other communities seems to go against the notion of echo-chambers, so more research is needed in this area.The most recent example of a real-world event being connected with a change in online behavior occurred with Donald Trump declaring COVID-19 a national emergency, when the mean number of comments per author dipped from 12.99 to 9.4 (p = 0.004) in Republican circles.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Juhász, C.",August 2025,English,"No

108578,Research Study A Meta-Regression Analysis of Environmental Impacts Across Warm Mix Asphalt Technologies,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108578,"This thesis evaluates the environmental performance of warm mix asphalt (WMA) technologies using a systematic two-stage meta-regression analysis of life cycle assessment data from numerous studies, using two specific indicator variables: energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions score. In stage one, WMA was compared to conventional hot mix asphalt (HMA), and stage two focused on studying the variation among different WMA technologies-Foaming, Chemical, and Organic. The findings show that there were generally lower environmental burdens from WMA technologies compared to HMA, but the difference between WMA technologies was pronounced, with organic and chemical additives generally presenting larger impacts than foaming additives, although these differences were not always statistically significant.This research work applied random-effects models with inverse-variance weighting to consider the heterogeneity in studies, and used imputed values to address missing values. While this approach helps in synthesizing diverse data sources, it also introduces challenges related to data consistency and the potential influence of imputed values on the results. Despite the variabilities across studies, the results allowed a quantitative assessment of the relative sustainability of WMA technologies.

This has resulted into declining house prices and negative social impacts for residents of Groningen. As the Netherlands is also facing a significant housing shortage, rapid and affordable construction solutions are needed. In this context, prefabricated timber construction emerges as a promising solution. Timber offers potential advantages in seismic construction due to its lightweight and ductile properties, while prefabrication aims to enable a quick and cost-efficient building process. Yet existing regulations such as Eurocode 8 and NPR 9998 provide limited guidance specific to timber. Addressing this, the research develops a decision tree to support early design-phase decisions for timber prefab housing in seismic areas of Groningen. The methodology combines a literature review, semi-structured interviews with structural engineers and a analysis of the current seismic design codes. The resulting tool helps designers to evaluate seismic boundary conditions, assess structural regularity and select appropriate connection types based on ductility class. The decision tree is demonstrated on a real prefab house design by the construction company Plegt-Vos. It is assumed that this design will be constructed in the highest seismic risk area of Groningen. The case study shows the tool can be used to support more structured, regulation-aligned design decisions in the aim of providing a time efficient design process. However, further refinement is needed in the assessment of structural regularity and in evaluating the ductile performance of timber connections. This thesis contributes a practical design aid for faster and more cost-effective timber housing solutions in regions of Groningen affected by induced earthquakes.

108575,Fair or Foul?: The Moderating Role of Internal Reference Price on Price Anchoring and Price Fairness,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108575,"INTRODUCTION: The anchoring effect is a cognitive bias in which individuals heavily rely on initial information when forming judgments. While high anchors often raise willingness to pay, findings remain mixed when anchors become implausibly extreme. This inconsistency may stem from the strength of consumers’ internal reference prices (IRPs), which represent price expectations shaped by prior experiences. However, the moderating role of IRP strength remains theoretically debated and empirically underexplored, especially in low-cost contexts such as restaurants, where perceptions of fairness play a critical role in consumer behavior. OBJECTIVES: This study investigates how the strength of consumers’ IRP moderates the relationship between the extremity of price anchors and perceived price fairness. It aims to determine whether extreme anchors are perceived as less fair and whether this effect varies depending on whether the consumers have a strong or weak IRP. Additionally, it explores how IRP strength affects visual attention to pricing cues using eye-tracking technology. METHODS: A survey-based experiment with 121 participants between the ages of 18 and 35 was conducted using fictional restaurant menus to simulate price anchor scenarios in both strong and weak IRP contexts. Participants were randomly assigned to view menus featuring either average market-based or extreme price anchors. Visual attention data were collected from a subset of participants (n = 42) using a Tobii Pro Fusion screen-based eye-tracker. RESULTS: Participants perceived prices as significantly more fair under average market-based price anchors than under extreme anchors. Linear mixed models confirmed the significant negative impact of extreme anchors on perceived fairness. However, no significant interactions were found between IRP strength and anchor type, meaning the moderating role of IRP could not be confirmed. Eye-tracking results showed that anchor items consistently attracted early and repeated attention, but attention to anchors did not significantly differ between strong and weak IRP contexts. CONCLUSION: The study confirms that price anchor type significantly affects perceived price fairness, with extreme anchors leading to substantially lower fairness ratings than average market-based anchors. Therefore, these findings suggest that businesses should be cautious when applying extreme price increases, as all consumers, even those without prior knowledge or strong IRPs, can recognize this implausibility.Conversely, no statistically significant evidence was found that IRP moderates this relationship, suggesting the IRP strength did not meaningfully alter the impact of anchor extremity. Nonetheless, fairness perceptions under extreme anchors were somewhat less negative in weak IRP contexts, implying a potential attenuation effect. Future research could further investigate the moderating role of IRP by strengthening the manipulation of the strong IRP condition.

108572,An efficient algorithm for finding forbidden minors in nongraphic binary matroids,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108572,"Matroids are a type of combinatorial structure; they provide a unified framework for studying many combinatorial problems, for example in the fields of linear algebra and graph theory. Various types of matroids can be defined on graphs, but a specific type is often called the `graphic matroid' - this is the matroid M(G) = (F, E)$ on an undirected graph G = (V, E) where F is the set of all forests in G. It has long been known that all graphic matroids are binary matroids (matroids with representation matrices over GF(2)), but not all binary matroids are graphic. Tutte proved that a binary matroid is graphic if and only if it does not contain any of four special 'forbidden'matroids as aminor- that is, there is no way to apply pivots to a representation matrix of a graphic matroid to make the representation matrix of these forbidden minors appear as a submatrix. This report contains, to our knowledge, the first sub-quadratic-time algorithm to find these forbidden minors. The algorithm that we present runs in O(n alpha(n,r) + r + c) time (where n is the number of nonzero entries in the input matrix, r is the number of rows, c the number of columns and alpha(n, r) is the slow-growing inverse Ackerman function). It makes use of the graph realization algorithm by Bixby and Wagner and the nonseparating ear decomposition algorithm of Schmidt.

108569,Understanding the Acceptance of Treated Wastewater Reuse Across Sectors and Provinces in Northern Netherlands,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108569,"Worldwide, growing pressure on freshwater resources has increased interest in reusing treated wastewater as an alternative water source. The objective of this thesis was to assess the social acceptance of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent reuse in agriculture, industry, and households within a selected region in the Netherlands. To address this objective, a mixed-method research design informed by the PESTEL framework (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal) was applied. First, exploratory interviews were conducted to inform the design of a survey. Subsequently, surveys were distributed across the three sectors with a total of 130 respondents. Finally, in-depth interviews were held with sectoral stakeholders to cross-verify survey findings. The findings reveal that effluent reuse acceptance is generally conditional and sector dependent. Across sectors, critical influencing factors include safety assurances, economic incentives, technological reliability, clear responsibility allocation, and regulatory clarity. Besides this, households in particular expressed psychological barriers, such as trust, health concerns, and discomfort with the concept of wastewater reuse. Multinomial logistic regression showed that only two demographic variables, namely age and prior experience, significantly influenced acceptance. This result, on the one hand, emphasizes the importance of tailored awareness strategies and pilots. On the other hand, methodological limitations limit the explanatory power of the analysis and underline that the results from the regression should be interpreted with caution and seen as exploratory rather than conclusive. Additionally, notable regional differences emerged, as respondents expressed varying local contexts and freshwater availability. However, statistical analysis did not prove that these local differences directly influence perceptions and acceptance rates. This aligns with the observation that end-users of all three sectors have equally set other priorities rather than local (climate) conditions, like technological safety and institutional responsibilities. So, the most effective approach for enhancing effluent reuse acceptance should be sector-specific and take multiple dimensions into account. For example, technical, social, and institutional aspects should be combined, different stakeholder needs should be considered, and both perceptions and practical barriers should be addressed, looking at behavioural, regulatory, and communication strategies together. To stimulate successful implementation, the main recommendations include clear regulatory frameworks, enhanced institutional communication on safety and reliability, and targeted economic incentives per sector. Future research should expand stakeholder engagement, including additional expertise from public health and infrastructure specialists, to further strengthen acceptance strategies.",Master Environmental and Energy Management (M-EEM),"Kadic, Š.",August 2025,English,"No

108566,Technical Skills Assessment in Manufacturing: A Rapid Review,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108566,"As manufacturing undergoes rapid technological transformation, ensuring that frontline workers possess the necessary technical skills has become a central challenge for workforce development. While sectors such as healthcare have established validated approaches for evaluating technical competence, manufacturing lacks a consolidated evidence base on how skills are assessed in practice. This rapid review synthesises empirical research on technical skills assessment for frontline workers in manufacturing environments. Guided by Stufflebeam’s CIPP evaluation model and the combined validity framework by Messick and theStandards for Educational and Psychological Testing, the study examines both the contextual drivers of assessment design and the psychometric soundness of reported practices. A targeted search of Scopus identified 16 empirical studies, which were analysed through structured data extraction and narrative synthesis. Findings reveal that assessment methods are shaped primarily by contextual and resource constraints, with widespread reliance on in-house, ad hoc tools developed for operational needs. Simulation-based, VR/AR-enabled, and observational assessments dominate, yet are typically implemented without formal validation, standardisation, or systematic assessor calibration. Content validity was the most frequently reported dimension, reflecting alignment with industry standards and authentic tasks, while construct validity received limited attention and reliability, fairness, and accessibility were largely neglected. In contrast, usability and feasibility were consistently highlighted, underscoring a strong emphasis on practicality over methodological rigour. These patterns reveal a persistent “innovation–validation gap,” where rapid adoption of immersive and digital technologies has outpaced psychometric evaluation. The review concludes that manufacturing urgently requires theory-informed, evidence-based frameworks that balance feasibility with scientific robustness. Recommendations are offered for future research and practice, including the need for structured rubrics, inter-rater reliability studies, fairness and inclusivity analyses, longitudinal evaluations, and cross-sector knowledge transfer from domains with established assessment traditions such as healthcare and aviation.

108565,Exploring the Intersection of End-to-End HD Mapping and HD Map-Based Localization: A Survey with Implementation Perspectives,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108565,"High-definition (HD) maps provide centimeter-level spatial accuracy essential for autonomous driving, yet traditional production workflows present significant scalability limitations due to resource-intensive data collection and manual processing. This thesis addresses the critical research gap by investigating the integration of two independently evolving domains: learning-based end-to-end HD mapping and HD map-based localization systems. Current approaches develop along parallel trajectories, limiting system adaptability as real-world autonomous systems require both continuously updated maps and precise localization within evolving environments. Through comprehensive literature survey, experimental validation, and architectural framework design, this research demonstrates the fundamental interdependence between mapping and localization performance. The comparative analysis reveals that both HD and standard-definition (SD) map-based approaches converge on transformer-based Bird's Eye View representations and cross-modal attention mechanisms, indicating that semantic-geometric correspondence learning represents the core technical challenge. HD map-based methods achieve centimeter-level accuracy under constrained conditions while SD map-based methods provide meter-level precision with superior tolerance to large pose uncertainties. Experimental validation establishes the fundamental interdependence between mapping and localization through systematic pose perturbation analysis that simulates real-world GPS/IMU positioning uncertainties. Localization experiments demonstrate that training with realistic pose uncertainties significantly enhances performance stability compared to idealized scenarios, while HD mapping experiments reveal a dual-threshold degradation pattern where fine-scale perturbations induce gradual performance reduction and large-scale perturbations precipitate catastrophic collapse. These findings establish that accurate pose estimation enables superior mapping through effective historical map integration, whereas pose uncertainties fundamentally compromise spatial correspondence and prior information retrieval. The proposed end-to-end architecture enables simultaneous HD mapping and localization through joint optimization, featuring hybrid prior map integration, dual-layer storage balancing stability with environmental responsiveness, and decoupled pose estimation maintaining computational efficiency. This research provides the first comprehensive survey bridging HD mapping and localization domains, establishes quantitative performance benchmarks, and identifies optimal integration strategies.

Unlike prior research, this thesis uses an observational method with video recordings of agile team meetings from a Dutch financial services company. Employee verbal behaviours were coded systematically, and meeting effectiveness was measured via post-meeting surveys. A mixed-method approach was used, combining thematic analysis and quantitative comparison through Mann-Whitney U and Chi-squared tests. The sample consisted of four agile teams, two monocultural and two multicultural teams, with a behavioural dataset of 4826 coded verbal behaviours over four meetings. Results show that only 11.9% of all observed behaviours constitute knowledge sharing behaviours, with multicultural teams showing relatively more knowledge sharing (16%) than monocultural teams (9.2%). Effective meetings showed higher levels of knowledge sharing than ineffective meetings. However, statistical analyses of the whole set of knowledge sharing behaviours revealed that these differences were not significant. For specific verbal knowledge sharing behaviours, “providing factual information” was significant for both mono- and multicultural teams. Multicultural teams appear to show more knowledge-sharing behaviours than monocultural teams, but they may face challenges with feedback due to cultural differences. This thesis contributes to agile team literature by providing behavioural insights into real-world interactions.

We focus on three core research questions: how to model silver objects when PyMca-derived metal composition vectors are available, whether comparable results can be achieved using only raw XRF spectra, and what insights can be taken from the analysis. To address these problems, we designed a modular framework that combines multiple input representations with a range of predictive models. Our experiments show that using PyMca-based metal composition features yields strong performance in year regression tasks. Surprisingly, we also find that models trained directly on raw spectra, without expert preprocessing, can in some cases approach the same performance. The proposed framework improves year prediction accuracy by over 25\% compared to the museum’s existing pipeline, and introduces new classification baselines for period, city, and maker.

Cultural institutions use tactile installations, prerecorded audio descriptions, expert led tours and other means to increase the accessibility of their institutions. Each of the already used techniques has their own advantages and disadvantages which a conversational agent (CA) could use to its advantage. This study proposes a CA as technological companion to visually impaired (VI) in addition to a tactile art representation. The CA was built using Realtime API by Open AI and  GPT-4o-realtime-preview LLM. Users from the target group in this study had tactile access to four artworks (two busts and two complex artworks) in the National Gallery in Prague (NGP), while having a discussion with the CA. Users were interacting with the CA in two conversation styles(1) Lecture style- the user is allowed to ask only one question (mimicking an audio guide);(2) Interactive style- the user has unlimited number of questions (mimicking a conversation with a friend or expert). This qualitative study was conducted with four VI users and offers the following insights:(1) Accessible art- VI users described accessible art as something that can be accessed with more senses than only sight -  most dominantly through touch, and experts described how their institutions create accessible art for VI visitors,(2) Conversation style comparison- all of the users preferred the interactive style over lecture style, which was favored for short and quick artwork descriptions,(3) User-centered CA design considerations- multiple design considerations for a CA designed for VI museum visitors were uncovered, such as: detailed descriptions, CA interruption, voice quality and trust.

108553,Performance evaluation of mental healthcare services scheduling policies,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108553,"The increasing demand for mental healthcare within the Netherlands has led to long waiting times in the GGZ (Geestelijke gezondheidszorg), the national mental healthcare institute. The treatment path that clients have to take consists of triages and multiple appointments for which they have to be scheduled. Inspired by this problem, this thesis developed a quasi-birth-death process to represent this treatment structure through a two-dimensional queueing system, referred to as thewagon-arrival-model. The aim of this model is to analyse the relevant performance measures, namely the expected queue length and waiting time. This is done for a scheduling-prioritised (SP) and matching-prioritised (MP) policy. For the SP policy, we prioritise scheduling as much clients as possible, whereas in the MP policy, we only schedule a customer if an available slot matches its type. The transition probabilities are analysed under different configurations -perfect, near-perfectandimperfect packing- which result in a state space that is either unbounded in one direction or in two directions along the axes. For cases where the state space is unbounded in a single direction, we are able to apply thematrix-geometric method. As this methodology is limited to a single unbounded direction, we have developed and applied themodified matrix-geometric methodas a methodology suitable for computing the stationary distribution in the cases where the state space is unbounded in two dimensions along the axes. The results indicate that the SP policy is more advantageous compared to the MP policy, particularly in the sensitivity of change in parameters and overall values. Furthermore, careful selection of parameter values is essential, depending on which specific performance measures should be optimised.

Addressing this issue is the central aim of this research: to integrate fairness considerations into the scheduling of junior surgeons, aligning operational efficiency with equitable training opportunities. This article wants to fill a gap in the literature about fairness among residents, since surgeons and patients have been studied extensively.

Due to the complex nature of glycaemic management in the hospital, combined with a lack of standardization, current management of inpatient hyperglycaemia is inadequate. One possible solution to this problem is decision support. Specifically, machine learning models that suggest optimal insulin boluses have shown promise in simulated studies. This thesis describes the development of a bolus suggestion machine learning model on retrospective, real-world data. Due to a lack of training data, the performance of the bolus suggestion model was not yet sufficient for clinical application. Therefore, suggestions are given on how to improve data availability, such that the methods can be applied more successfully in the future.

Previous literature shows that different tensions arise in platform co-ops. This thesis explores how platform co-ops navigate different tensions, how these tensions are prioritised, and who takes the lead in addressing them within the democratic decision-making process. Using a semi-structured interview design, this study, which includes a total of nine interviews, including one recorded observation, provides insight into the democratic decision-making process regarding tensions in platform co-ops. Findings reveal six tensions identified in this thesis regarding platform co-ops, all of which relate to the financial difficulties of these co-ops. All platform co-ops in this thesis are struggling to balance the financial viability of the platforms with their social cooperative nature. Regarding the democratic decision-making process, are the tensions related to finances also prioritised, showing the importance of financial sustainability in platform co-ops. The aspect that financial sustainability plays a significant role in the prioritisation of the different tensions and participation of members in the democratic decision-making process highlights another view of Cornforth’s (1995) Degeneration Thesis, a more internalised version of the Degeneration Thesis. Economic pressure makes members less likely to participate in democratic governance, unintentionally creating a situation where dominant members will adapt capitalist practices from the inside. Eventually this pattern, will weaken democracy by creating a vicious cycle. When dominant members/board members make most decisions, it will further reduce engagement, helping to establish a vicious cycle where economic capitalist pressure often undermines the social mission and democratic process of the platform co-ops.

108547,Assessing traffic safety improvements when using vehicle sensor friction data for winter road maintenance measures decision-making in the Netherlands,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108547,"This research focused on developing and evaluating a predictive model that uses probe vehicle data to identify slipperiness risks on national main roads. The model aims to support winter maintenance coordinators at Rijkswaterstaat in making timely decisions about preventative salting, with the goal of reducing crash risk during winter weather conditions. The objective of this research was to understand the usefulness of probe vehicle data from frictional vehicle sensors, which provide slipperiness information, for effective and timely winter maintenance decision-making in winter weather, that can help prevent crashes. Using random forest models, the relationships between friction, indicated by probe vehicle data, and temporal and spatial factors were analysed. Essential temporal factors as road temperature below 0 degrees Celsius, condensation and precipitation, are important indicators for slipperiness. Spatial factors, especially curved exits, had a significant influence on the probability of low friction, which is aligned with the knowledge from traditional winter road maintenance methods. The results show, however, that the model can recognise important slippery events, like the 18thof December 2022, where the Netherlands was covered in black ice, but it is not suitable as a predictive tool for operational decision-making. It is not possible to meet the 2-hour interval with this model, and it seemed to overfit the low-friction predictions, which would create too many false alarms in practice. This is partly due to static spatial features that get too dominant in the prediction. Nevertheless, the research identified promising application possibilities for probe vehicle data. The data could be helpful for curative salting actions, real-time monitoring of slipperiness (particularly for dilution of salt and identification of blind spots) and evaluation of salting decisions. Interviews with winter maintenance coordinators highlighted concerns about the reliability, timeliness and representativeness of the data. These concerns imply that, although the data shows technical promise, its operational adoption will depend on improvements in coverage, real-time accuracy, and trust in the outputs. In conclusion, the model could not, in its current form, be used as a primary predictive source for operational decision-making.

108546,Does it hurt to try?: A qualitative study of patients’ experiences with Long Covid interventions,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108546,"Background:Long Covid is a complex, chronic disease with significant impact on the health and daily functioning of patients. Due to the lack of proven treatments, patients and doctors try interventions with hypothetical efficacy, such as nattokinase, serrapeptase, pacing and intermittent fasting. This thesis explores Long Covid patients’ experiences with these four interventions, focusing on their motivations, usage patterns and perceived (side) effects. The objective is to contribute to the development of the websitelongcovidtoolkit.org, which aims to combine scientific research and patient experiences to reduce the lack of information and support informed treatment choices for Long Covid. Methods:A qualitative descriptive study was conducted using semi-structured online interviews. Participants were Long Covid patients who had experience with at least two of the interventions. An interview guide was developed based on literature and input from stakeholders, and used to conduct the interviews. The interviews were then transcribed and coded inductively by using an experimental AI-software, and later Microsoft Excel. Results:Five participants used nattokinase hoping it would improve symptoms like brain fog, fatigue, muscle pain, and circulation problems. It was usually taken as a capsule, often 100 mg (2000 FU) daily, with some combining it with serrapeptase. Despite their hopes, most participants reported no noticeable effect on symptoms and discontinued use. No side effects were reported. Serrapeptase was used based on its theorized anti-inflammatory and circulatory effects, with participants discovering it through social media. It was taken in capsule form, usually on an empty stomach, with daily dosages between 80,000 and 120,000 SPU. The two participants often used it alongside nattokinase and experimented with dosage combinations. No clear benefits or side effects were reported, in contrast to the literature suggesting possible symptom relief and minor side effects. All nine participants used pacing to reduce PEM, manage fatigue, and stabilize energy levels, often learning about it from professionals or online platforms. Pacing involved strict planning, energy monitoring, rest periods, and tracking tools like smartwatches or activity scoring systems. Although demanding and emotionally taxing, pacing was considered effective in preventing relapse and managing various physical, neurological, and systemic symptoms. There were no physical side effects, though participants experienced emotional strain and social limitations. The four participants started intermittent fasting to improve energy, lose weight, or manage symptoms, influenced by previous experience or recommendations. Most followed a time-restricted schedule (e.g., 16:8), limiting intake to specific hours while only drinking water outside eating windows. Some reported improvements in fatigue and brain fog within a week, though others saw no benefit. Side effects included hunger, headaches, and low blood sugar, especially during initial use. Discussion and conclusion:Even with the limited number of participants in this study, findings showedthat participants were predominantly positive about the functioning and effectiveness of pacing. Participants were somewhat less enthusiastic about intermittent fasting, as it appeared to have more disadvantages than benefits. Both nattokinase and serrapeptase were mostly mentioned in a negative light, with participants experiencing little to no effects.",Bachelor Health Sciences (B-GZW),"Morskate, B.H.F.",August 2025,English,"No.

108545,"Building Bridges, Not Barriers: Exploring Designer–Client Communication  Through a Serious Game",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108545,"Objectives. The discovery phase in UX design involves collaboration to reach consensus on project goals. However, traditional methods like paper documents and slide decks may not fully support this process, particularly when power dynamics or communication issues arise. Although serious games have been explored in various contexts, their use in design is underexplored. This study explores how both designers and clients communicate using a serious game Journey in a discovery workshop through the theoretical lenses of framing, symbolic interactionism, communication accommodation, and cognitive dissonance. Methods. This qualitative study combined in-game observations, field notes and post-session semi-structured interviews across three workshops involving designers (n = 9), a real client (n = 1), and role-playing clients (n = 5). Interviews explored participants’ experiences of the game and reflections on their interactions. A thematic analysis was used to identify recurring patterns in communication behaviors and group dynamics across interviews, observations, and field notes. Results and Conclusion. Findings show that framing the session as a bridge-building activity shifted participants’ focus from confrontation to collaboration. Participants could express abstract ideas visually through tangible game materials. Some designers adapted their communication through observation and imitation, while others were already in ‘default’ interaction style, relying on established styles formed by prior experience. Clients did not display cognitive dissonance as expected but asserted dominance, reflecting context-specific factors. Their engagement not only relied on game realism but also on how the activity was introduced and framed. Keywords.

While past research has often focused on influencer reach and engagement metrics, this study looks more closely at how followers perceive authenticity, and how those perceptions impact trust and brand loyalty. Using a qualitative approach, 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted with Gen Z participants in the Netherlands. Thematic analysis, supported by the Gioia method, revealed four key themes: Authentic Self-Presentation, Perceived Transparency, Relatability and Identification, and Platform Affordances. These themes show that authenticity is not just about being “real,” but about emotional openness, consistency, and how well influencers adapt their content to platform norms. The findings highlight that trust and emotional connection are built through a mix of personal storytelling, clear ad disclosure, relatable experiences, and the right tone for each platform. TikTok’s casual style made authenticity easier to perform, while Instagram’s polished visuals often made it harder. This study contributes to existing research by showing that authenticity is shaped by both influencer behavior and platform design. The results offer useful insights for marketers and influencers looking to build stronger, trust-based relationships with Gen Z audiences.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Yeszhanova, S.",August 2025,English,"No

108542,The Impact of eWOM Valence in the Context of Greenwashing: Exploring Consumer Responses and Spillover Effects in the Sportswear Industry,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108542,"This study investigates the impact of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) valence consumer responses (attitude, brand trust, purchase intentions) within the context of greenwashing. As consumers increasingly scrutinise sustainability claims, understanding reactions to eWOM in such scenarios is both timely and relevant. The study also explores whether these effects spill over to a competing brand within the same industry, addressing a gap in existing research. Nike served as the focal brand and Adidas as the competing brand. Additionally, the potential mediating role of perceived green authenticity (PGA) was examined. A between-subjects experimental design exposed 175 Dutch participants to a simulated Instagram post from Nike promoting its environmentally friendly campaign, followed by one of four eWOM conditions: no eWOM, positive eWOM, negative eWOM, or mixed-neutral eWOM. Results showed that eWOM valence did not significantly influence consumer responses or spillover effects. PGA did not mediate these relationships but was positively and significantly associated with consumer responses. These findings challenge assumptions about the persuasive power of eWOM in shaping consumer perceptions in the context of greenwashing, particularly for well-established brands on Instagram. Possible explanations for the null effects include unmeasured variables such as environmental concern, pre-existing brand attitudes, and the artificial setting of the experimental design. The study suggests that PGA may be a determining factor in shaping consumer responses. Future research should adopt more ecologically valid experimental settings, account for consumer-level factors, and manipulate the persuasiveness of eWOM.",Master Communication Science (M-COM),"Rödel, F.J.",August 2025,English,"No

Even though structural and measurable aspects have been studied extensively, the emotional dimension remains underexplored. Hence, this research explores how psychological contract breaches (PCBs) influence purchasing managers’ emotional responses and willingness to collaborate, and whether these effects are moderated by supplier dependence. Scenario-based role-playing experiments with 17 purchasing professionals were conducted to do so. Participants were exposed to different supplier scenarios, while their emotional responses were recorded using facial expression recognition software, and their willingness to collaborate was measured through survey questions. Partial least squares equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used for the data analysis. PCBs are found to reduce willingness to collaborate, having a damaging effect on buyer-supplier relationships. Contrary to expectations, however, PCBs did not significantly influence positive or negative emotions, nor did emotions have a significant effect on willingness to collaborate. Similarly, these relationships were not significantly moderated by supplier dependence. Therefore, willingness to collaborate is reduced by PCBs, irrespective of emotional responses or dependency. This research contributes to the literature through the offering of quantitative evidence of PCBs’ negative impact on collaboration, while contradicting assumptions about emotions in supply chain decision-making. Practically, the findings highlight the need for purchasing managers to deal with breaches carefully, even when emotions are not expressed, and to manage dependence strategically to maintain collaboration in the long term.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Ohan, M.K.",August 2025,English,"No.

108538,Clarifying Laughter's Communicative Function: An Audio-Visual Approach to Classifying Laughter in Dialogue Acts,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108538,"Laughter plays a pragmatic role in human communication, conveying different meanings to the conversation, from social expressions to communicative intentions such as agreement, affiliation, or assessment. Despite its importance, laughter remains a challenge for spoken dialogue systems to interpret accurately, especially in understanding the intentions behind laughter in conversational dialogue. This research investigates the pragmatic role of laughter, examining its corresponding dialogue acts and exploring how laughter patterns and audio-visual cues facilitate classification, thereby discriminating between different laughter intentions.To achieve this, an analysis of laughter event annotations with their corresponding dialogue acts was conducted, followed by a feature-level analysis of both acoustic and visual features, which differentiated the characteristics of laughter and statistically examined the acoustic and visual features that were significantly different across dialogue acts. Finally, an audio-visual classification model utilising fusion techniques has been experimented with.The research involved preprocessing and extracting a laughter-only dataset, along with corresponding dialogue acts, as well as audio and video segments. Experimental results demonstrate that acoustic features, particularly those derived from fine-tuned pre-trained models, provide the most reliable cues for laughter intention classification. Visual features, while usefully discriminating between different lip movement patterns for laughter intentions, degraded the model's performance. This is due to dataset limitations, underscoring the need for more sophisticated multimodal fusion strategies and richer, more balanced datasets. The thesis contributes by identifying crucial audio-visual cues that characterise laughter intentions and demonstrates the practical benefits of multi-modal fusion approaches for laughter intentions classification. The study highlights the potential for improving the interpretation of dialogue systems, particularly in understanding the pragmatic role of paralinguistic signals, such as laughter, in conversation.Keywords: Dialogue Acts Classification, Laughter Intention, Audio-Visual, Conversational Speech",Master Interaction Technology (M-ITECH),"Ho, H.P.",August 2025,English,"No

In Indonesia, most older adults with dementia are cared for by family members, with practices deeply shaped by cultural traditions, religious routines, and intergenerational responsibilities. Yet, many existing storytelling interventions have been developed in high-income countries, often for institutional settings, and assume levels of digital infrastructure and caregiver expertise that do not reflect Indonesian realities. The aim of this study is to explore how guided prompts, sensory elements, and culturally meaningful themes can be integrated into a storytelling tool that aligns with the daily rhythms and values of Indonesian families. Grounded in principles of person-centred care, inclusive design, and the Montessori approach to dementia engagement, the project emphasises emotional well-being, user participation, and cultural familiarity. This work positions storytelling as a familiar, collaborative, and accessible activity.

108535,The effect of perceived resource scarcity on different domains of risk-taking behaviour in procurement decisions,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108535,"This study investigates the effect of perceived resource scarcity on two dimensions of risk-taking behaviour among procurement professionals, addressing a research gap in empirical supply chain literature. Drawing on foundational literature such as Scarcity Mindset Theory, a quantitative survey was administered to business-to-business purchasing managers. The survey utilised multi-item scales to differentiate between procurement-specific and general risk-taking behaviours. Hierarchical linear regression analysis, controlling for age and gender, was employed to assess the relationships. Findings suggested a marginal trend toward a positive association between perceived resource scarcity and procurement-specific risk-taking behaviour. This suggests that procurement professionals may adopt riskier strategies when perceiving resource constraints, potentially to avert immediate supply losses. In contrast, no significant relationship was found between perceived resource scarcity and general risk-taking behaviour, indicating a domain-specific impact of scarcity within professional contexts. This thesis offers theoretical insights by illustrating how perceived scarcity may selectively influence risk preferences and underscoring the importance of distinguishing between different risk dimensions in professional settings. Practically, these insights offer valuable implications for organisations seeking to develop more effective risk governance frameworks and refine supplier communication strategies to mitigate suboptimal decision-making during periods of perceived scarcity.

108534,How to perform ESM research on grief in daily lives of children and adolescents: The perspectives of experts,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108534,"Abstract Introduction When people suffer from Prolonged grief disorder (PGD), they suffer from the consequences of grief for a prolonged period of time. A previous study has used Experience Sampling Method (ESM) to measure symptoms of PGD in daily life, which gives a good view of the fluctuations of grief during the day. This study has been focused on adults. There is relatively little known about PGD in children and adolescents. To adapt this previous ESM study to this target group, it is necessary to develop suitable ESM items to measure PGD symptoms in daily life, specifically for children. Also, it is important to investigate methods to prevent dropout rates and investigate possible changes that need to be made in ESM research to make it acceptable and feasible for bereaved children. Additionally, it needs to be studied what effect an ESM study focusing on grief will have on children and adolescents. Materials and methods Nine experts in ESM participated in online interviews. The first part of this study focused on how cognitive-behavioural ESM items should be measured in bereaved children. Therefore, an Excel sheet was created, in which the experts could assess potential ESM items created by the research team, using the ESM-Q scoring template. This ESM-Q scoring template consists of ten criteria for a good ESM item (e.g., “The item is short”). Expert interviews focused on the feasibility of an ESM study in bereaved children and the expected effects of this study, using a semi-structured interview with 20 questions, both open and closed. TheReactions to Research Participation Questionnaire(RRPQ) was adapted and used for investigating the expected effects of the ESM study on children and adolescents. Results Experts have decided upon what ESM items should be asked to study cognitive-behavioral factors within bereaved children and adolescents. Experts also gave their opinions on how these items should be asked, the frequency, length, the starting time of the first measurement and the ending time of the last measurement. The most notable recommendations were thatthe ESM study should not be longer than two weeks, the number of measurements per day should be between two and five, the duration of each ESM measurement should be between two and five minutes and participants should choose the starting and ending time of the ESM measurements each day.Experts ranked methods to prevent dropout rates, where money, regular contact with researcher and visualizing progress were the best options. Lastly, experts used a questionnaire to assess the acceptability of performing this ESM study on children, which could be considered acceptable. Discussion Our findings show that it is necessary to implement certain requirements provided by the experts on previously performed ESM studies, to adapt them for children and adolescents. Experts have decided upon nine sufficient ESM items that can be used in an ESM study that focusses on grief within children and adolescents.The best methods to prevent dropout rates according to experts were rewarding with money, regular contact with the researcher and a visual representation of the progress for participants.

This study explores the roles, responsibilities, motivations, impact, and compensation experiences of cancer patient advocates in the Netherlands. Guided by Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, and adopting a financial perspective, this qualitative research utilized semistructured interviews. Data was collected from nine Dutch cancer patient advocates, ensuring diverse representation across various cancer types and organizational affiliations. Findings reveal advocates undertake multifaceted roles, including direct information provision and peer support, representation in committees and working groups, and broader public awareness and policy advocacy. Their commitment is primarily fuelled by intrinsic motivation, stemming from a deep desire for impact and connection. While financial compensation (e.g., expense reimbursement, occasional honoraria) is present, its efficacy is complex; paradoxically, it can lead to crowding-out effects. Crucially, the perceived fairness of compensation, rather than simply its monetary value, emerged as a critical factor influencing motivation, especially when advocates observed perceived inequities or felt their growing expertise wasn’t commensurately valued. Non-financial compensation such as explicit feedback and recognition, autonomy and robust support, and opportunities for professional development, emerged as vital, cost-effective job resources that foster well-being and sustained engagement. A significant finding was the frustration stemming from tokenistic engagement, where advocates felt confined to “listener” roles, which demonstrably eroded their motivation despite strong intrinsic drives.  This research underscores that effective advocacy demands genuine recognition and strategic provision of resources that nourish intrinsic drive. For organizations and finance professionals, this translates into a strategic imperative: investing in non-monetary appreciation systems offers a high return on investment by sustaining a dedicated volunteer workforce. These insights are crucial for optimizing resource allocation and enhancing the long-term financial sustainability of patient advocacy in a patient-centred healthcare landscape.

108531,Exploring Personality Traits and Feedback in Promoting Environmentally Friendly  Choices: A VR-Simulator Study,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108531,"Background: While awareness of environmental issues is widespread, a persistent attitude–behavior gap limits the adoption of sustainable consumer practices. Previous research highlights the role of attitudes, perceived control, and social norms (Ajzen, 1991; Steg & Vlek, 2009), traditional interventions often rely on static or text-based methods with limited ecological validity. Virtual reality offers an immersive platform for simulating real-world consequences and delivering dynamic, real-time feedback, shown to enhance engagement and influence pro-environmental behavior (Ahn et al., 2014)Aim: The present validation study as part of a broader research project aimed to investigate whether immersive positive and negative feedback influences eco-friendly purchasingdecisions over time in a VR shopping environment. Additionally, it explored whether personality traits can moderate participants' responsiveness to feedback.Methods: A pre-test survey was conducted to establish realistic price thresholds for ecofriendly food products. Followed by an online survey, among other measures assessed Big Five personality traits using validated instruments. In the main VR experiment, participants made repeated purchasing decisions while receiving either positive (environmental improvement) or negative (environmental deterioration) feedback. The primary behavioral outcome, eco-friendly choice per trial, was analyzed using Bayesian logistic regression models. Due to limited sample size, personality measures were excluded.Results: Results showed that negative feedback led to a gradual increase in eco-friendly choices over time, whereas the initially high eco-friendly choices in the positive feedback condition declined. Personality measures were not included due to sample size limitations.Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of immersive negative feedback to sustain pro-environmental behavior in VR, suggesting that universal feedback strategies may be more practical than personality-tailored approaches at this stage. Findings provide a foundation for future large-scale studies and support the use of VR as a promising tool for developing environmental behavior change interventions.Keywords: Sustainable consumption, Personality traits, Locus of control, Eco-friendly products, Consumer behavior, VR-Study",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Klingebiel, C.A.",August 2025,English,"No.

108530,Exploring power trace capture setups for side-channel analysis using the test-vector leakage assessment on a RISC-V target,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108530,"Side-channel analysis (SCA) is a serious security threat to devices at the edge. In SCA, power or EM measurements are used to detect leakage of sensitive data such as the encryption key in cryptosystems. A critical metric to evaluate the leakage of such systems is the industry-standard test-vector leakage assessment (TVLA) metric. Multiple different solutions are currently used for capturing power traces of a microcontroller program. This includes expensive industrial-grade oscilloscopes, specific hardware platforms for SCA such as the ChipWhisperer family, or emulation-based trace capture such as ELMO that rely on power models of target devices. This research aims to investigate whether trace collection is feasible with more accessible and generic setups while utilizing a hardware-in-the-loop approach, taking into account effects that do not occur in an emulated environment such as memory access, the power use of different peripherals, and microcontroller types. It also opens up the possibility of replacing targets without having to create new power models. This is useful as much of the existing body of research focuses on Arm-based targets, while very few works have explored the vulnerability of commercial RISC-V-based microcontrollers. One of the open challenges of hardware that is less dedicated for SCA is the lower sample speed for a trace capture compared to the clock frequency of the microcontroller. To overcome this, a solution might be to utilize a larger capture buffer to calculate the TVLA metric over a collected trace of a single encryption operation instead of per sample. Unfortunately this discards the possibility of determining which instruction is responsible for leakage, which makes it interesting to also investigate the leakage effects of individual instructions. We look at two different types of systems to capture power traces on this target: a ChipWhisperer CW-Lite designed specifically for SCA, and a Joulescope JS220+ as a more generic capture solution. For these two measurement setups the limitations are explored. Trace collections and TVLA calculations are done on AES operations or single instructions with different sample speeds and execution speeds, and both per operation and per sample. The results show that while the JS220+ has potential uses for finding regions of interest in large datasets, the sample speed is not high enough to gather useful results from the TVLA procedure. On the other hand, through looking at the power profile of single instructions and the critical path, we show that single instructions are leaky and that it is possible to gather useful data with lower sample speeds, enabling better use of the small buffer of the CW-Lite.

108526,Designing a Reference Architecture for Application Portfolio Management in ServiceNow.,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108526,"Modern organizations face persistent challenges caused by complex, fragmented, and redundant application landscapes that lead to poor integration, weak IT governance, inflated operational costs, and misalignment between IT and business strategy. These issues are often worsened by outdated legacy systems, resulting in reduced productivity, increased technical debt, and ultimately hindering innovation and growth. In response, Application Portfolio Management (APM) has become a central focus within Enterprise Architecture (EA) to help organizations rationalize applications, optimize costs, and align IT assets with strategic goals. While various APM solutions exist such as Excel-based approaches or EA tools like LeanIX, Adorg, or Ins-pi as shown in the Gartner Magic Quadrant, many organizations are now moving towards platform-based solutions like ServiceNow that offer stronger integration, governance, and automation. However, a clear gap remains in the development of structured, platform-specific guidance for implementing APM in a way that reflects organizational maturity. This gap is especially evident for ServiceNow which is widely used but inconsistently applied. This thesis addresses this gap by developing a Reference Architecture for ServiceNow APM. The research follows the Design Science ResearchMethodology guided by the six-step empirically grounded RA design method proposed by Galster and Avgeriou. The study combines a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), business case analysis, empirical investigation, artifact design, and practical validation. A detailed SLR Review identified frameworks, best practices, challenges, maturity models, KPIs, and implementation approaches for APM. The SLR informed the development of the RA. The best practices and challenges from the literature were correlated with practical insights from the business case analysis to ensure the RA addresses real-world needs. The business case compared ServiceNow EA and APM with other solutions confirming ServiceNow’s alignment with TOGAF ADM phases, governance strengths, and scalability. To en-sure empirical grounding, semi-structured interviews were conducted with Plat4mation consultants who implemented ServiceNow APM for clients at different maturity levels. Insights were supported by Statements of Work, project contracts, workshop slide decks, and internal process documentation, leading to Reference Implementations that show practical configurations and variability. The RA integrates three key ArchiMate viewpoints which are the Capability Map, Value Stream Capability, and Implementation and Migration Viewpoints. These enable organizations to structure APM activities according to maturity and strategic goals. Variability modeling across these viewpoints captures optional modules, scaling parameters, and maturity plateaus, ensuring the RA remains adaptable for different industries and use cases. Validation through internal workshops and an online questionnaire (n=32) confirmed that the RA is perceived as useful, high quality, and variable enough to support diverse ServiceNow APM implementations.However, the RA currently extends only to Maturity Level 3 due to limited empirical evidence for developing a future Maturity Level 4 which would integrate AI capabilities.

High-fidelity 3D models of the carotid arteries derived from black-blood MRI are useful for quantifying biomarkers such as plaque volume and wall shear stress. However, inter-slice misalignment frequently occurs in MRI scans due to patient motion between acquisitions, degrading the accuracy of reconstructed 3D models.This thesis investigates methods to quantify, reduce, and evaluate the impact of inter-slice misalignment in black-blood MRI scans. First, a simplified adaptation of the loss of coverage metric is introduced to quantify misalignment severity. This metric is then tested using simulated artifacts on a reference dataset. Second, rigid image registration is applied to our dataset to minimize the inter-slice misalignment present in some of these. Finally, carotid artery segmentations are used to construct 3D models from the scans before and after correction, and their quality is assessed using surface smoothness. The results demonstrate that inter-slice misalignment was not correctly quantified or reduced. The proposed metric proved inaccurate for quantifying inter-slice misalignment, and rigid registration often failed to improve alignment, sometimes introducing new artifacts. As a result, the reconstructed 3D carotid models did not show an improvement in quality. These findings underline the limitations of current correction methods. This demonstrates the need for more advanced registration methods, tighter integration with segmentation, or more accurate metrics for detecting the presence and severity of inter-slice misalignment.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Kuiken, J.A.",August 2025,English,"No

These EVCSs are notorious for being sources of EMI. The conducted EMI caused by an EVCS is highly dependent on its power level, topology, and applied modulation scheme. This paper investigates the influence of control methods on the resulting conducted EMI by simulating and comparing various Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modified (SPWM) techniques. The specific focus will be placed on a three-level Neutral Point Clamped front-end inverter and a Dual Active Bridge back-end DC-DC converter. Respective applied modulating methods for these topologies are SPWM and single phase shift techniques. The results show highly differing conducted EMI patterns as a result of the varying SPWM control signals applied, with little effect from the back-end converter. Further results show the possibility to mathematically model and predict conducted EMI patterns resultant of the chosen SPWM control signal. This study concludes that conducted EMI from a DC EVCS is primarily caused by the front-end inverter, showing significant levels with respect to the natural grid frequency. Further conclusions show differing levels of conducted EMI per control signal in simulated and modelled SPWM based multilevel inverters.

108514,Augmented Reality Grammar Checker: A Study on Time Behavior and Educational Usability,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108514,"This study explores the implementation of large language models in an offline augmented reality grammar checker on resource-constrained devices, broadening accessibility for Indonesian learners. The primary goal is to provide rapid and accurate grammatical corrections for text captured by learners. Using sub-1 billion parameter models (Gemma3 1B, Olmo2 1B, Qwen3 0.6B, and Llama3.2 1B), I evaluated the performance impacts of 8-bit and 4-bit post-training quantization using the llama.cpp inference framework for Android. Results show that 8-bit quantization maintains grammatical error correction accuracy within 0.02% of GLEU and 1.3% of the F0.5 score. Additionally, 4-bit quantization reduces GLEU by approximately 3.2% and the F0.5 score by 18.2% relative to float16. However, quantization enhances inference speed, improving prompt processing throughput by up to 167% and token generation performance by roughly 124%. Furthermore, hardware acceleration using the 4-bit Olmo2 model on Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 delivers up to an 8.5x speedup (172 tokens per second prompt processing and 8.28 tokens per second token generation) with 380.2 ms latency.

108513,Evaluating the addition of ECM-TA and Gel-TA to a 5 wt% Dex-TA/HA-TA hydrogel for cartilage regeneration,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108513,"The development of scaffolds for cartilage regeneration requires materials that combine mechanical stability, biocompatibility, and support for extracellular matrix (ECM) formation. Hydrogels based on tyramine-functionalized dextran (Dex-TA) and hyaluronic acid (HA-TA) are promising candidates due to their tunable properties and cytocompatibility. In this study, the effect of incorporating tyraminefunctionalizedproteins gelatin (Gel-TA) and ECM (ECM-TA) into Dex-TA/HA-TA hydrogels was investigatedwith respect to material properties, cellular responses, and the influence of mechanical stimulation. Bulk experiments demonstrated that cell-laden hydrogels exhibited increasing stiffness and metabolic activity over 21 days, which suggested cartilage-like ECM deposition, which was confirmed through histology, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence (IF) staining, and Tomocube imaging. In contrast, chip-based experiments over shorter culture periods (14 days) revealed more subtlechanges, with gene expression aligning with bulk results, with the Pristine and ECM-TA conditionsexhibiting more ECM deposition, but IF indicating more collagen II and aggrecan deposition in theGel-TA condition. Importantly, both bovine and human chondrocytes remained viable and produced cartilage-specific ECM across all hydrogel formulations. Although Gel-TA and ECM-TA did not consistently outperform the Pristine Dex-TA/HA-TA hydrogel, the results highlight the capacity of this hydrogel system to sustain chondrocyte function and support cartilage tissue formation.

108512,Development and up-scaling of Mixed Matrix Membranes for uremic toxin removal,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108512,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects the lives of more than 850 million people worldwide and this number is only expected to increase. It is likely that CKD will be one of the main causes of death by 2040. The most viable treatment option for CKD is kidney tranplantation, however as the need for renal replacement therapy grows and the availability of donor organs remains unchanged, effective other treatment options become increasingly more vital. Hemodialysis, currently the most commonly used technique, still shows an insufficient removal of protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs), such as hippuric acid (HA) and indoxyl sulfate (IS). This is caused by the high binding affinity of these these toxins to plasma proteins. Current dialysis methods focus on toxin removal by the principles of diffusion and convection, which are only able to remove the free, unbound fraction of PBUTs. Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), developed by Tijink et al. (2012), enhance PBUT removal by introducing adsorption as a third mechanism. These membranes consist of two layers: an inner standard dialysis membrane, and an outer layer embedded with activated carbon particles. Adsorption shifts the PBUT binding equilibrium, resulting in increased overall removal. MMMs are typically made from a hydrophobic polymer, polyethersulfone (PES), blended with a hydrophilic additive, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), to increase hemocompatibility and permeability. Of the PVP variants, the high molecular weight version (K90) is often used in high-flux membrane production. A recent switch in K90 supplier to support up-scaling at the Advanced Organ bioengineering and Therapeutics (AOT) department caused changes in membrane morphology and decreased permeability. As a result, optimal production settings had to be reassessed, with focus on scalability, reproducibility, and compatibility with the midi-scale MEMS set-up. Optimization was carried out using a lab-scale dry-jet wet spinning set-up, producing 15 fiber types with varying inner- and outer-layer polymer solutions, bore fluid compositions (NMP/water), extrusion speeds, and pulling wheel speeds. A 4% glycerol treatment, typically used for storage, was found to improve permeability without affecting adsorption. Morphology and permeability were assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and clean water flux (CWF) testing. The final optimized fiber, MMM18, treated with 4% glycerol, achieved an ultrafiltration coefficient (Kuf) of 42 ± 7 mL·m−2·h−1·mmHg−1, within the desired 40–80 range. Upscaling was tested using the midi-scale MEMS set-up. Although spinning speeds were 5–10× higher than in the lab scale set-up, tuning of bore composition and pulling speed led to successful reproduction of the membrane structure and high permeability. However, the MEMS-produced fibers showed large pores in the selective layer, not observed in lab-scale fibers. Further tuning is needed for a full transition between scales.MMM18 fibers were tested in vitro using a Repligen dialysis set-up, with custom dialyzers containing 4 and 12 fibers for plasma and blood experiments, respectively. Both human plasma and full blood were spiked with 110 mg/L HA and 40 mg/L IS. PBUT removal was determined by measuring concentration decreases in plasma/blood and increases in the dialysate. MMM18 showed significantly better removal than commercial FX-1000 membranes: HA and IS removals in plasma were 2381 ± 374 and 437 ± 108 mg·m−2, compared to 1290 ± 231 and 200 ± 146 mg·m−2, respectively. The effect was more pronounced in blood: HA removal was 3× higher and IS removal between 3–10×. MMM18 had slightly improved HA removal over previous MMMs, while IS removal decreased slightly, likely due to its large bore limiting contact with carbon particles. In conclusion, this study shows that MMMs can be optimally produced using the new PVP K90 in a K30/K90 blend. Upscaled production using the MEMS system is feasible, as demonstrated by MMM18: a reproducible, high-flux membrane with improved PBUT removal. Further optimization is needed to reduce bore size while maintaining permeability and to refine the lab-to-MEMS scale transition. Integration of MMM18 in larger-scale dialyzers could enable more clinical-like dialysis studies and facilitate comparison with commercial dialyzers.

108511,Designing an adaptive autonomous guided vehicle for educational purposes in ROS2,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108511,"The Department of Design, Production & Management initiated the challenge to design a transport system for the learning factory. This system should autonomously transport products between workstations while also serving as an educational tool. This project presents the design of an adaptive Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) build within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) framework which can be used in a learning factory environment. The AGV is designed using the ROS2 framework to support modularity, real-time communication, and flexible configurations. The individual lifecycle nodes allows subsystems to be independently modified or replaced. This adaptability enables students to experiment with different subsystems and it allows the AGV to adjust its behaviour to the environment, for example, by reducing speed when approaching humans or fine-tuning its positioning precision based on workstation requirements. The development followed the V-model, starting with a stakeholders wishes which led to specific requirements. The resulting design uses a combination of sensors including LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors, and cameras, for obstacle detection and QR-code based positioning. Existing ROS2 packages are used for the wheel control, navigation and simulation. These simulations can be executed in Gazebo and RViz, which allows users to test functionalities or different sensors before physical prototyping. This supports learning without the risk of damaging hardware. The educational value is further supported by documentation, validated though testing with both a technical student and teacher. The documentation is managed in Notebook LM, an artificial intelligence (AI) tool capable of generating graphs, summaries, answer questions and making fault tree analysis. This helps users to better understand the system and trace and solve problems easily.

108508,Context Matters: Investigating How Social Environment and Location Moderate the Relationship Between Emotion Regulation and Negative Affect in Daily Life,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108508,"Maladaptive emotion regulation (ER) strategies, such as suppression (i.e., inhibiting emotional expressions) and rumination (i.e., repetitive negative thinking), are linked to various forms of psychopathology, including depression and anxiety. These strategies contribute to elevated negative affect (NA), characterized by distress and negative emotions and are commonly observed in individuals with these conditions. As NA is rather dynamic and changes in response to emotional demands, it is crucial to investigate it in day-to-day environments. However, so far, little research has captured the complexity of how everyday life contextual factors, such as social environment or location, may be associated with the effectiveness of ER. To address this gap, the present study focused on the ER strategies suppression and rumination,subsequent NA and contextual moderators, including social presence, social closeness, mode of interaction, and location. Healthy participants (n = 53) received semi-random notifications on a research smartphone ten times per day over eight consecutive days to report on their momentary ER, affect levels and contextual factors. Time-lagged analyses showed that rumination at one point in time was linked to more NA at the following time point (b= 0.08,t= 4.27,p< .001), whereas suppression was not.None of the moderation analyses were supported.

In addition, they serve important ecological functions as a home to unique biodiversity and as a support system for surrounding communities by providing agricultural resources, food security, and water. However, peatlands particularly in Indonesia, have been highly degraded due to land conversion, water exploitation, and repeated forest fires. Reflecting on these issues, rewetting peatlands and raising public awareness are urgently needed. Based on prior research from Peatland.eu, which shares a similar motivation in the context of a European virtual living lab, this study expands the concept and ambition of a virtual living lab into the Indonesian context by developing Peatland.asia. The platform is designed with gamified mechanics to promote social-ecological learning through play- ful interaction.

This paper evaluates complementary data-driven and physics-based approaches using sensor-equipped moving-floor trailers. Data-driven experiments included univariate time series forecasting of multi-day wear and multivariate prediction of daily wear. In the univariate setting, time series models were tested under recursive and multi-step strategies to examine the role of lookback length and forecast horizon. Results show that recursive forecasting best preserved monotonic wear trends and a cleaned univariate baseline, particularly the Bidirectional LSTM, achieved strong long-range forecasts, while GRU excelled with shorter histories. In the multivariate setting, a Bayesian-optimized DNN yielded the best daily prediction, and an hourly sequence-to-one LSTM achieved even higher accuracy. Transfer learning with pretrained models (VGG19, ResNet50, MobileNetV3) provided only modest benefits and generalized poorly under LOGO. Complementing these, a physics-based model based on Archard’s wear law produced interpretable predictions with minimal data, though calibration of the wear coefficient was required.

108501,Future-Proofing Sustainability: Exploring Drivers and Barriers to Industry 4.0 Adoption for CSRD and CSDDD Compliance,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108501,"This research explores the drivers and barriers shaping the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies. Including AI, blockchain, IoT, and Big Data Analytics, in the context of the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). Using the combined Technology–Organization–Environment (TOE) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) frameworks, the study examines how technological, organizational, environmental pressures, and individual attitudes interact in the adoption process. Empirical insights are drawn from semi-structured interviews with professionals working in supply chain management and sustainability roles. The findings indicate that adoption factors can be divided into regulation-specific and non-regulation-specific dimensions. Regulatory drivers, such as mandatory adoption requirements and compliance with due diligence standards, left companies with little choice but to adopt new tools. At the same time, non-regulatory drivers included efficiency gains, process integration, leadership influence, supportive organizational culture, and intrinsic motivation among employees. Additional enablers included improved supply chain visibility and the ability of digital systems to integrate with existing infrastructures. On the barrier side, interviewees pointed to high costs, outdated infrastructure, tool fragmentation, and technology lock-in as significant challenges. Lock-in effect emerged unexpected constraint: once firms had invested in a given system and trained staff, switching to more suitable solutions was perceived as prohibitively difficult. Budget allocation conflicts, leadership hesitancy, and regulatory uncertainty further complicated adoption decisions. From the individual perspective, barriers such as system complexity, non-tailored solutions, and doubts about long-term usefulness discouraged engagement.

108499,Beyond Practices: Spillovers of Sustainability Communication between Digitally Linked Companies,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108499,"This thesis examines how sustainability communication spillovers occur within ecosystems of digitally connected companies. Prior research has focused primarily on spillovers of practices, such as production innovation or ethical sourcing. However, less is known about how public sustainability communication itself diffuses across firms. Drawing on institutional theory and the concept of mimetic isomorphism, this research investigates the spillover of sustainability communications of the digitally linked peers, and whether industry affiliation and firm size moderate this effect. Using the website content analysis tool ISTARI.AI, the research addresses a set of exploratory research questions. The findings provide consistent evidence that sustainability communication does spill over between digitally connected firms. Importantly, these spillovers do not occur at a single point, but unfold over time, as shown by lagged spillover model. The results further suggest that spillovers are stronger when firms operate within the same industry, suggesting that shared norms and stakeholders’ expectations strengthen the diffusion. In contrast, firm size does not significantly influence the strength of spillovers, suggesting that digital communication does not pose traditional firm size asymmetries. This thesis contributes to sustainability communication theory by showing that communication diffuses across organizational boundaries and shapes industry norms. Moreover, the findings suggest that firms should view their sustainability communication not only as a reporting tool but also as a strategic mechanism. Overall, this thesis provides new insights into how sustainability communication spreads across firms, being both an enabler of institutional changes and a potential source of strategic challenges.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Wronkowska, J.E.",August 2025,English,"No.

Traditional queue theory methods often fail to capture real-world dynamics and human factors, while the application of advanced machine learning models, specifically Transformers, remains largely unexplored in this domain. This thesis proposes a framework combining Transformer models, Explainable AI (XAI) and process mining techniques to optimise digital queue management and staff scheduling. We train and compare multiple Transformer models against a Random Forest Regressor baseline for predicting busyness (queue lengths and wait times). XAI methods are then used to improve trust and transparency and interpret the model's predictions. Finally, process mining techniques are used to identify operational bottlenecks to further improve the queueing process. Results show that while Transformers outperform the baseline by capturing the shape of the signals, machine learning might not be suitable for this specific task. XAI provides valuable insights into the decision-making process of the model, and process mining successfully identifies essential bottlenecks.

108497,Reactions to an Online Labor Platform's Market Exit (An Exploratory Research to Investigate the Reactions to the Sudden Departure  of Deliveroo from the Dutch Market),https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108497,"In recent years, the rise of the gig economy has gone hand in hand with growing instabilities,including the sudden withdrawal of major platforms from national markets. One such case isDeliveroo’s exit from the Netherlands in 2022, which abruptly ended the working relationshipwith thousands of riders. This sudden loss of income, combined with the absence of supportmeasures such as severance pay or outplacement services due to their independent workerstatus, makes such events critical to examine as career shocks. While career shock theory offersuseful frameworks to understand how individuals respond to unexpected career events, researchhas mostly focused on traditional employment settings. As a result, limited knowledge existsabout how such shocks are experienced in more precarious and flexible work environments likeplatform-based gig work.To address this gap, this study investigates how former Deliveroo riders made sense of theplatform’s exit from the Dutch market, using career shock theory as a guiding lens. Eighteensemi-structured interviews were conducted and analyzed using a combined coding approach:deductive (based on career shock dimensions), inductive (to analyze emerging themes fromshock dimensions), and pattern analysis (to explore potential interrelations within codedelements).Findings show that emotional valence (whether participants experienced the event negatively,neutrally, or positively) served as the central outcome through which the shock experiencebecame interpretable. Valence was shaped by the interaction of career shock dimensions(disruption, criticality, foreseeability) and contextual factors (deteriorating working culture,algorithmic management, and individual career plans), revealing an important result: shockdimensions are interrelated and their interplay shapes emotional responses. Another key resultis the frequent presence of neutral reactions, particularly among riders who perceived Deliverooas a side activity. These cases enrich current understanding of emotional valence in career shockexperiences by showing that a shock can still have an impact on individuals’ career trajectories,even when emotional involvement is limited.This research contributes to career shock and gig economy literature by contextualizing shockexperiences in platform-based work and calls for future research to advance knowledge on howthe interplay of career shock dimensions shapes workers’ experiences and also investigate howthe outcomes of such shocks compare to shocks in traditional employment settings.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Lepidi, L.",August 2025,English,"No

However, the need for comprehensive data analysis often clashes with strict privacy regulations and the fragmented nature of health care data. While federated frameworks such as the FAIR Data Train (FDT) aim to preserve data sovereignty by bringing computation to the data, they lack standardized mechanisms for coordinating multi-step analyses and enforcing strict access control. To address these limitations, we designed a novel FDT-based orchestration architecture that integrates the Common Workflow Language (CWL) and the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) into the FDT framework. A Train Coordinator component was developed to interpret high level analytical goals and translate them into modular CWL workflows. These workflows dynamically determine which data to access, under which conditions and when to invoke policy validation. Data access permissions are enforced through machine-readable ODRL policies, which are evaluated before data retrieval to ensure compliance with provider de f ined constraints. The resulting system was validated using a pharmacovigilance use case focused on assessing adverse drug reactions of natalizumab. The prototype demonstrated its ability to coordinate conditional workflows across federated data stations while enforc ing privacy constraints through embedded policy checks.

Explainable Active Learning (XAL) aims to address these challenges by selecting informative data samples for labeling and providing explanations for model decisions. However, little is known about how and when the quality of explanations evolve across successive active learning cycles. This research investigates this evolution by implementing a framework based on functionally grounded metrics like Continuity, Compactness, Correctness, Consistency, and an aggregated metric called XAI Quality score (XQS). These metrics are computed on two widely used XAI methods, SHAP and GradCAM, which are applied to ResNet-34 model that is trained via entropy-based uncertainty sampling on both PCAM (medical) and CIFAR-10 (natural) imaging datasets. Results show that while active learning enhances both predictive accuracy and explanation quality with few samples, evolution of explanation depends greatly on dataset domain, choice of XAI method and evaluation metrics employed. This thesis also addresses the challenges of using pre-trained Deep CNN and only a single active learning strategy as well as the feasibility of aggregated metric fine-tuned for medical imaging. It provides an initial framework for tracking and evaluating the evolution of explanations in XAL workflow that can be further enhanced using un-trained lightweight models, domain-adaptive metrics, computational optimization, and diverse active learning strategies.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Chidara, S.",August 2025,English,"No

This creates barriers to sharing information effectively and conducting comprehensive analysis across different agencies. This thesis tackles this problem by transforming the Humanitarian Exchange Language (HXL) into an ontology built using OWL and following SABIO for methodology development guidelines. The primary objective was to create a system that improves data sharing and integration to support coordination and decision-making in operations that require collaboration between multiple organizations-organizational situations. The ontology was iteratively designed and validated using competency questions derived from real operational workflows and synthetic datasets modeled after authentic humanitarian data structures. The validation revealed that the ontology successfully integrates diverse datasets, executes complex SPARQL queries, and maintains compatibility with spreadsheet-based workflows familiar to field practitioners. Prototype demonstrations with domain experts confirmed its practical utility and highlighted positive feedback on its potential to reduce data reconciliation errors, improve analytical accuracy, and support inter-agency information sharing. Several challenges were identified during the study, including limited access to authentic humanitarian data, difficulties in establishing long-term partnerships with operational agencies, and untested scalability in high-volume or real-time environments. Additionally, some non-functional requirements, such as multilingual support and open-access publication for collaborative refinement, remain as priorities for future work. Nevertheless, this research proves that incorporating HXL into a formal semantic framework offers a practical solution for improving data connectivity in one of the world's most fragmented information environments. The completed ontology, sample datasets, and processing workflows are publicly available for continued research, adaptation, and implementation.

The lack of diverse, realistic rain datasets prevents models from achieving high robustness to adverse weather conditions. Existing methods for synthesizing such datasets simplify the nature of rain by ignoring appearance variations, geometric interactions, and various rain-related weather effects.This work presents a comprehensive approach to rain synthesis and removal. A new pipeline, Cascade Rain Synthesis, simulates realistic rain streaks, depth-aware fog, puddles, and wet surfaces with high visual plausibility. The resulting dataset is used to train a new rain removal model MultiMask Derain, that handles different types of rain separately, improving accuracy while preserving image details.The proposed pipeline outperformed other existing synthesis methods in terms of perceived realism in a user study. The deraining method achieves strong results on standard metrics such as PSNR and SSIM, and improves task-based metrics such as semantic segmentation accuracy and object detection precision. Together, these contributions aim to improve the realism of synthetic rain and strengthen the robustness of vision systems in adverse conditions.

Through qualitative interviewswith float pool managers from two hospitals, the study examines the competing rationales thatinfluence cooperation and resource sharing in the context of coopetition, where hospitalscollaborate while also remaining competitors. Findings reveal that professional and corporatelogics support collaborative approaches, while market logic often acts as a barrier, driven byconcerns over competition and staff retention. Personal experience, clinical background, andleadership values also play a key role in how managers interpret strategic decisions. By usinginstitutional logics as an analytical framework, the study contributes to the literature onhealthcare workforce flexibility by showing how institutional logics interact, and how they maybe reconciled in practice. These logics are not ends in themselves, but a theoretical perspectivethat helps identify realistic and context-appropriate solutions.

108490,A Toolkit for Performing Network Measurements on Bandwidth Brokers,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108490,"In the current Internet, many clients have a need for accessing online content indirectly. This need may arise from a desire of anonymity, for avoiding censorship or avoiding georestrictions. The main two technologies to this end are proxies and VPN’s. In this work we will specifically be looking into Bandwidth Brokers (BB), a special kind of Residential Proxy (RP) that offers residential proxying capabilities like RPs, but differs in the fact that it has an explicit voluntary recruitment method. The users are recruited through marketing their service as a form of passive income, by offering compensation for proxying traffic. RPs have been used extensively in research, but their use has become scrutinized after suspicions rose of these services enabling malware, and that they might have involuntarily recruited IoT devices as part of their network. Like RPs, BB have seen use in academia in recent publications, but no knowledge exists whether equal scrutiny applies to BBs as it does for RPs. To conclusively answer this question direct measurements on clients of these services are necessary. We present a measurement toolkit that is designed to perform measurements on these BBs. Furthermore, we provide guidance on how this research can be performed from an ethical perspective. After design, implementation and validation of this toolkit, successful deployment yielded 7.5 months of measurements, which formed the basis of a paper published to the 20th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM).

This has a negative impact on the waiting times and the quality of care. Therefore, this paper aims to explore how data-driven analyses can be utilized to tackle this problem by creating more insights in care pathways, discovering optimization opportunities and supporting value-based healthcare. The focus will be on employing process mining techniques for pancreatic cancer patients and text mining for lung cancer patients. As the waiting times for pancreatic cancer exceed the norms of Stichting Oncologische Samenwerking (SONCOS), process mining has been used to map the diagnosis and treatment process and identify key bottlenecks. The results show that there is high variability in the processes (9.9%), indicating that each patient follows a unique path. The median durations for diagnosis, surgery, and chemotherapy were found to be 32 days, 31 days, and 15 days, respectively. The bottlenecks in the diagnosis occur at endo-echography (median: 6 days), while in the treatment phase, delays arise from repeated outpatient clinic visits and CT scans (median: 6 days). For lung cancer patients, postoperative complications are poorly registered. To address this, text mining techniques have been utilized to extract the complication ""air leak longer than 5 days"" from clinical notes. For this, the pre-trained model MedRoBERTa.nl was used, achieving the following performance: accuracy = 0.97, precision = 0.86, recall = 0.86, and F1-score = 0.86.

While primarily single-server Keyword PIR schemes have been explored in prior work, they often incur significant performance costs due to reliance on heavy cryptographic assumptions, offline preprocessing phases, and client-side state that must be maintained across queries. These limitations complicate deployment in dynamic environments with frequent database updates, since each client must remain synchronized with the latest database state, making it harder to support multiple clients reliably. In this work, we present HydraPIR, a scalable multi-server Keyword PIR framework that addresses these limitations. HydraPIR achieves efficient single-round private keyword searches without requiring any persistent client state or preprocessing. At its core, HydraPIR combines hierarchical cuckoo hashing with Distributed Multi-Point Functions (DMPFs), enabling clients to retrieve key-value pairs by keyword while scanning all server partitions (buckets) in parallel. Our construction supports dynamic databases with efficient server-side updates and achieves query bandwidth that scales logarithmically inN(database size), resulting in communication costs comparable to state-of-the-art index PIR schemes. Across multiple datasets, HydraPIR achieves query response times between 10–130 ms depending on the database size and record sizes, with up to 657xfaster retrieval compared to state-of-the-art Keyword PIR baselines. We also further extend HydraPIR to a four-server version that enables efficient private permanent updates to database content without revealing which records have been modified. Lastly, we introduce variants of the two and four-server HydraPIR constructions that leverage bit-optimized DPFs, which are simplified DPFs that eliminate the need for costly group operations to achieve faster performance for PIR queries.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Garalov, T.",August 2025,English,"No

However, existing datasets and methods lack the granularity to link specific objects within paintings to their rich, non-obvious symbolic descriptions. This critical gap hinders the development of applications like localized Visual Question Answering and detailed semantic search within artworks. This thesis addresses this challenge by introducing a novel dataset of 7,087 paintings where detailed, symbolic descriptions are grounded to specific painting regions. We propose and validate a semi-automated annotation pipeline that leverages Large Language Models for both extracting and judging the quality of these complex annotations, ensuring high fidelity. Furthermore, we investigate the novel application of Visual Grounding models for this grounding task. We demonstrate that a state-of-the-art model, Grounding DINO, can effectively localize objects using these long-form, non-obvious descriptions as referring expressions, challenging the conventional reliance on short phrases. We then propose a method to extend Grounding DINO into a powerful bimodal encoder by extracting latent representations from its internal layers and projecting them into a shared embedding space using Multi-layer Perceptron heads optimized with a contrastive loss. Our empirical evaluation shows that this approach significantly outperforms established models like CLIP in cross-modal retrieval, achieving up to a 2.65-fold increase in Mean Reciprocal Rank. The obtained embeddings also prove valuable for analyzing the symbolic relationships between objects.

As the main healthcare provider on the island, FM relies on timely transport of laboratory samples, blood products, and medicines across the ABC islands, yet current methods depend on inflexible and disruption-prone third-party carriers. A discrete-event simulation model was developed to assess how UAVs could complement or replace existing logistics. The model incorporates route structures, payload limits, scheduling constraints, and emergency deliveries, while also comparing UAV operations with helicopter alternatives. Findings show that UAVs are highly effective for small, frequent, and time-sensitive shipments such as lab samples and blood, while chemotherapy transport remains challenging under current constraints.

AI voice filters, deepfakes, and generative models produce music that constitute simulacra, inducing a state of hyperreality wherein it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish the simulated from the real. The meaningfulness of music is likely to collapse due to this hyperreality along with the oversaturation and homogenization of music produced through the use of AI technologies. The replicative nature of generative AI models is likely to lead to a lack of uniqueness and diversity among musical expressions and may potentially lead to the disruption and death of the historical flow of popular culture as understood traditionally.","Master Philosophy of Science, Technology and Society (M-PSTS)","Ansari, M.S.",August 2025,English,"No

108476,Cybersecurity Readiness & NIS2: Is the healthcare sector prepared?,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108476,"In today’s digitally driven world, where technology increasingly connects people and systems, cybersecurity has become more critical than ever. The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT)—with over 50 billion devices online by 2020—has provided ample opportunities for cybercriminal activity. To counter these cybercriminal activity the European union announced to apply a new legislation in terms of cybersecurity focused on critical sectors, called the NIS2 directive. Amongst the sectors affected by this new directive is the healthcare sector, which has been a sector particularly affected by cybercrime. Research with regards to cybersecurity readiness and readiness for NIS2 have been lacking. In addition to this, no research has been conducted to analyze cybersecurity in the healthcare sector as a whole. This study investigates how technological, organizational, and environmental factors of cybersecurity readiness influence regulatory preparedness under the NIS2 directive in the healthcare sector. While cybersecurity readiness and compliance are both IT functions, the former is an internal aspect and the latter an external IT function. Furthermore, compliance alone does not guarantee cybersecurity readiness and vice versa. The central research question is: To what extent does cybersecurity readiness determine readiness for NIS2 in healthcare organizations? A literature review and expert interviews were conducted in order to formulate a conceptual framework. The TOE framework was utilized to measure cybersecurity readiness. The TOE method consists of three contexts: technological, organizational and environmental. Readiness for NIS2 was measured by taking into consideration compliance to NEN7510 and awareness by top management. The model consists of 11 observable and 2 latent variables, to overcome this complexity the least-squares partial data analysis method was utilized. The data was collected by means of a survey, the total amount of responses were 62 IT specialists in the healthcare sector. The results were that the level of cybersecurity readiness has a positive significant effect on readiness for NIS2. Meaning that when a healthcare organization has a higher level of cybersecurity readiness it is also more likely to be ready for the new NIS2 directive. This study makes both theoretical and practical contributions to the cybersecurity literature. Theoretically, it fills a gap by empirically linking sector-wide cybersecurity readiness to regulatory preparedness under the NIS2 directive in healthcare, extending the TOE framework to include regulatory outcomes. It demonstrates that technological, organizational, and environmental factors jointly predict not only cybersecurity readiness but also compliance readiness, highlighting the critical role of organizational governance. Practically, the proposed model provides actionable guidance for healthcare IT professionals, consultants, and policymakers by identifying key readiness factors, informing investment priorities, and enabling benchmarking against peer organizations, thereby supporting strategic planning and efficient resource allocation.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Veenstra, J.",August 2025,English,"No

108475,Managing Application Portfolios: A Security-Aware Rationalization Framework,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108475,"In large enterprise environments, maintaining a secure and efficient application portfolio is a growing challenge, especially as aging or redundant applications increase security vulnerabilities and operational complexity. This thesis proposes a systematic, security-oriented application rationalization framework aimed at identifying and reducing IT risks while optimizing application portfolios. Building on a structured literature review, the framework integrates both business and security criteria, such as business criticality, known vulnerabilities, usage frequency, and technical debt, into a six-step process. The framework was validated using real-world data from a financial organization, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying redundant or high-risk applications, engaging stakeholders, and guiding rationalization decisions. A follow-up refinement phase incorporated feedback from practical application, emphasizing the importance of stakeholder collaboration, visibility into application ownership, and flexible categorization logic. The results highlight how structured rationalization initiatives can improve IT governance, reduce security exposure, and support long-term efficiency and resilience in managing enterprise application portfolios.",Master Business Information Technology (M-BIT),"Ismail, F.N.",August 2025,English,"No

108474,ESG Risk-analysis: Analysing the risks faced by Fast-Moving Consumer Goods firms in light of the CSDDD regulations,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108474,"The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) enforced from July 2026 onwards, focuses on providing accountability for firms and their human and environmental impact throughout firms’ own operations and from business partners. Eligible firms face uncertainty and need to intensify their supply chain risk management approaches to become aligned with the CSDDD. The study performed a risk-analysis focused on ESG-data retrieved from LSEG Workspace, to identify topics which can decrease the controversies fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms undergo, either affecting an increase or decrease in investor confidence. The study was conducted through a quantitative approach, using linear and logistic regressions to find significant relationships between variables. Results show three variables affecting the controversy score either in a positive or negative way. For instance, the study finds that more intensive ESG training with supply chain partners will decrease the number of controversies which occur. Furthermore, it is shown that a decrease in ESG controversies will impact the dividend per share and therefore impacting investor confidence. The study identified five topics to help FMCG firms prepare for the CSDDD, together with theoretical implications for ESG-based risk analyses.

108473,Cross Modality Model Merging,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108473,"Deep learning models are often fine-tuned for individual tasks, making them less efficient. Training a model on different tasks together is possible but has it's own challenges and is computationally expensive. Model merging offers a lightweight alternative to joint training, but its application to multimodal settings remains limited. While prior research has focused primarily on vision-language merging, little attention has been given to merging modalities such as vision and audio. This thesis investigates the use of the EMR-Merging to combine models trained on images and audio. Multiple vision models and an audio model are merged, and an interpolation strategy is explored to balance performance between modalities. This work is carried out in three stages: Weighted Averaging, Multimodal merging using EMR, and Interpolation. Weighted averaging serves as a naive baseline and results in severe performance degradation across all tasks. EMR-Merging of unimodal (vision-only) models achieves strong vision performance, but when extended to multimodal merging with an audio model, vision accuracy decreases while audio performance is maintained.Interpolation between unimodal and multimodal EMR models shows that low alpha values preserve high vision accuracy, while larger alpha values improve audio performance, though still falling short of fine-tuned baselines. Overall, the results highlight the trade-offs in merging vision and audio modalities and contribute a baseline, an interpolation strategy, and a comprehensive evaluation across vision and audio datasets.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),Saurabh Joseph,August 2025,English,"No

108472,Enhancing Human-AI Collaboration: Investigating the Mediating Role of Human-AI Skills on Collaborative Outcomes,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108472,"With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in business operations,its impact on employees and organizations continues to increase. This motivated the present study to focus on three types oforganizationalsupport:digital leadership, AI facilities, andAIintegration. In addition, the studyexamines how organizational support and human-AI skills contribute to improved Human-AI collaboration outcomes conceptualized as efficiency, creativity, and decision-making. While previous research has typically considered technological orskill-centeredperspectivesin isolation, this study integrates both perspectives to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that drive successful human-AI collaboration. Using a quantitative approach, survey data were collected from 163 professionals who work with AI. The regression analyses revealed that digital leadership was significantly associated with higher levels of creativity and decision-making, whereas AI facilities and integration showed no direct effects on collaboration outcomes. However, human-AI skills emerged as a strong predictor of collaborative outcomes. Mediation analysis showed full mediation for Human-AI skills on the relationship between organizational support variables and collaboration outcomes. For AI facilities and integration, only indirect effects via AI skills were significant. In the case of digital leadership, both direct and indirect effects were significant. This highlights the important role of Human-AI skills in successful Human-AI collaboration. This study contributes to the literature by empirically demonstrating that Human–AI skills form a crucial link between organizational support and collaboration outcomes. It highlights the need for organizational support structures that actively enable employees to develop their Human–AI skills, as stronger skills lead to better collaboration outcomes.

108471,Sensor-Integrated Bone-Plate for Monitoring Healing Progression in Tibial Fractures and Preventing Overloading,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108471,"Background and Objectives:Current fracture healing assessment relies primarily on radiographic imaging and clinical examination, both of which provide intermittent and subjective information. These methods cannot quantify real-time mechanical stability at the fracture site, which is essential for guiding clinical decisions such as weight-bearing progression, rehabilitation planning, and timely identification of delayed or nonunion. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a sensor-integrated system capable of continuously monitoring interfragmentary micromotion as a direct indicator for callus stiffness during fracture healing. Materials and Methods:A pin-based sensing construct was designed to measure relative displacement across a simulated tibial fracture gap. Three sensing element concepts were investigated: two polymeric resistive designs using conductive thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and one strain gauge-based design mounted on a non-conductive compliant TPU beam. A phased experimental approach was employed: (i) calibration under controlled displacement (Phase 0), (ii) evaluation of displacement transmission in a full construct (Phase 1), and (iii) testing under simulated healing stages (no callus, soft callus, hard callus) at physiological load levels (250 N and 500 N) (Phase 2). Results:The results demonstrated that Concept 1B achieved a high gauge factor (5.3) while maintaining low forces on each pin (~4.4 N at 1 mm displacement), a critical factor in preventing loosening of the construct. Its output showed moderate correlation with displacement (R² = 0.89). Concept 2 was excluded after Phase 0 due to poor signal stability. Concept 3 exhibited the highest accuracy and stability, with excellent linearity (R² = 0.99) and a strong signal-to-noise ratio. Both Concept 1B and Concept 3 successfully differentiated between healing stages under axial loading at 250 N and 500 N. Conclusions:This work demonstrates that direct monitoring of fracture gap displacement is feasible using both polymer-based and strain-gauge–based sensor systems. Concept 1B prioritized mechanical safety by keeping pin forces low while still detecting displacement trends, whereas Concept 3 delivered better accuracy and stability at the expense of higher pin forces and fabrication complexity. These results highlight the trade-offs between safety and sensitivity, and introduce a promising alternative pathway for developing simple, scalable, and clinically relevant smart implant systems for direct monitoring of fracture healing progression.

108470,Practical inter-laboratory reproducibility of clinical 3D gait analysis of a single healthy subject in 3 different laboratories by adopting a standardized measurement protocol,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108470,"Background:Three-dimensional gait analysis is widely used in clinical biomechanics, but its reproducibility across laboratories remains a challenge, even under standardized protocols. For multi-center studies such as TopTreat (Toward Personalized Treatment of Osteoarthritis), establishing reference ranges of inter-laboratory variability is essential to distinguish pathology-related differences from inter-laboratory measurement variation. Research question:How reproducible are gait outcomes (anthropometrics, spatiotemporal parameters, inter-marker distances, kinematics, and kinetics) across laboratories when a harmonized protocol is applied? Methods:One healthy male subject (29 years) performed walking, stepping-down (SD), and sit-to-stand (STS) tasks in three laboratories, each with an independent examiner. A standardized protocol defined baseline anthropometrics, marker set, marker placement, and task execution. Outcomes included anthropometrics, spatiotemporal parameters, inter-marker distances, joint kinematics, kinetics, and knee joint forces (via Conventional Gait Model 2 (CGM2)) were estimated. Variability was assessed using peak ranges, absolute differences, and waveform correlations. Results and significance:Walking was most consistent (knee flexion variability < 6.5°, knee moment ≤ 0.23 Nm/kg). SD produced the largest discrepancies (up to 7.9° flexion and 0.58 Nm/kg moments). Spatiotemporal parameters and GRFs showed high reproducibility, while joint angles and forces were moderately variable; net moments were least reliable. Differences were primarily linked to examiner-dependent marker placement rather than equipment. These findings establish reference thresholds for inter-laboratory variability in healthy subjects, supporting interpretation of patient outcomes across TopTreat sites and emphasizing the need for standardized examiner training and harmonized protocols.

108469,Moral Decision-Making Under a Scarcity Mindset: Examining the Application of a Neurophysiological Approach with EEG,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108469,"Existing literature has examined the effect of a scarcity mindset and the mechanism of moral decision-making separately, in both the business management and neurophysiological fields. This academic paper explores the influence of a scarcity mindset on the moral decision-making process to open the black box ofhowone makes immoral decisions. Experiments were conducted with twenty-four organisational purchasers. The participants made decisions on everyday business context moral dilemmas, for four different degrees of interpersonal relationships (protagonists: i.e., colleague, manager, supplier and rival). Scarcity and abundance mindsets were induced through controlled feedback of the number of remaining tokens after each small game. EEG recordings were made for the whole duration of the experiment. The study employed Event-Related Potentials analysis to compare the brain activity between the groups and the protagonists. ERP analyses suggest that there was higher visual attention and task engagement in the scarcity group, reflected in N1 and P2 components. An FFT analysis of the mid-frontal theta waves supports the scarcity manipulation. A tendency of interaction effect between the groups and the protagonists was observed in LPP. The difference in the EEG data between the groups suggests an overall increase in focus on the tasks under scarcity. The paper contributes to both the business management and neurophysiological fields by suggesting that (1) a scarcity mindset alters the cognitive process during moral decision-making, (2), level of perceived scarcity and the consequences may affect one’s behaviour under scarcity, (3) the effect of a scarcity mindset on moral decision-making in business-related everyday moral dilemmas, (4) the overall increase in focus under scarcity may help explain the underlying mechanisms of tunnelling effect, and (5) there can be a new degree of the interpersonal relationship (rival protagonist).

108468,Towards Standardized Inverter Design and Control for C-HIL Implementation: Assessment Under Varying Grid Conditions,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108468,"The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, primarily interfaced through inverter-based systems, introduces significant challenges in maintaining grid stability and performance under varying conditions. Tools such as MATLAB Simulink and Typhoon HIL are widely used and highly effective for validating power electronics systems; however, inverter operation is often highly sensitive to grid characteristics. Many existing studies focus on isolated scenarios, leading to custom designs for each application or unclear design decisions. This work aims to streamline the inverter design process and enable the development of inverters that are less sensitive to grid variations while staying within practical design constraints. It also lays the groundwork for a future automated control-hardware-in-the-loop (C-HIL) simulation framework. Modular inverter models are developed for C-HIL implementation, incorporating both grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) control strategies using {dq}-reference frame voltage and current control. A detailed analysis of the grid’s short circuit ratio (SCR) is conducted to assess inverter performance under different grid strengths, revealing a trade-off between power quality and stability: GFL benefits from high SCR, while GFM provides better stability under low SCR conditions. The influence of an LCL filter on system dynamics is also examined. Additionally, a benchmarking study compares the robustness of SRF-PLL and DDSRF-PLL synchronization techniques in GFL inverters under weak grid conditions. Finally, the stabilizing effects of active damping are demonstrated, particularly in very weak grid scenarios.

108467,Renewable energy in the media: Exploring media framing of geothermal energy in Indonesia,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108467,"Background:The transition to renewable energy has become a global agenda, and Indonesia is among the countries pursuing this shift. Geothermal energy represents one of its most promising resources, with the nation ranked as the world’s third largest in geothermal potential. However, the expansion of geothermal power generation has faced resistance from local communities. In the context of energy transition, the media plays a crucial role in shaping public discourse. Through framing, the media can influence both public opinion and policy. This has led to growing scholarly interest in media and renewable energy. Nevertheless, research specifically on geothermal energy and more broadly on renewable energy in the Global South remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by examining how Indonesian media frame geothermal energy and how these frames are constructed. Methods:This mixed-methods study combined quantitative and qualitative content analysis of online news articles on geothermal energy with semi-structured interviews with journalists. The SPEED framework was applied in the coding scheme to identify dominant frames, while the hierarchy of influences model was used to analyse the frame-building process. Results:Among the six SPEED framing categories, the environmental frame appeared most often, though differences with other frames were modest. Media attention focused largely to gas leaking incident, local community resistance, and regulatory challenges. Coverage was generally reactive, superficial, and fragmented, resulting in a polarised narrative. Government, the most cited actor, framed geothermal energy as clean and economically beneficial, justifying regulatory acceleration for project expansion. NGOs, in contrast, portrayed it as environmentally harmful and socially disruptive. The researchers or experts were rarely cited. These framings were shaped by influences at multiple levels, from individual journalist autonomy and newsroom routines to institutional priorities and extra-media pressures, with internet-driven digitalisation permeating each level. Conclusion:This study underlines the need for more balanced, integrated, inclusive, and scientifically informed media coverage of renewable energy, stronger engagement from researchers, and greater support for science journalism to foster richer and nuanced narratives, contributing to a more just and informed energy transition.

While viewers may recognise such content as AI-generated, those with unrealistic beliefs about AI’s capabilities may interpret AI-generated outputs as evidence that the presented information is accurate or credible. This reflects the novel concept of perceived AI omniscience, understood as the belief that AI possesses complete knowledge, which can foster belief in misinformation, such as conspiracy theories.Objective: This study introduces and examines the role of perceived AI omniscience in the relationship between prior exposure to AI-generated conspiracy content and belief in conspiracy theory. It tests whether prior exposure increases belief, whether perceived omniscience amplifies this effect, and whether AI literacy reduces perceived omniscience.Methods: In an interactive online video survey participants’ prior exposure to AI-generated content about aliens constructing the pyramids, perceived AI omniscience, AI literacy, and belief in this conspiracy theory was measured. Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesized relationships.Results: Perceived AI omniscience had a significant positive effect on belief in the conspiracy theory, while AI literacy significantly reduced perceived AI omniscience. Prior exposure to AI-generated conspiracy content and the interaction term did not have a significant effect on belief.Conclusion: Participants who viewed AI as omniscient were more likely to believe the conspiracy theory, while AI literacy reduced such perceptions.

108459,Developing a Teacher-Centered AI Support Tool for Consistent Rubric Application and Efficient Essay Grading,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108459,"Manual essay grading remains central to academic assessment, yet is persistently challenged by grader inconsistency and cognitive demands. Fully automated grading systems offer efficiency but often lack transparency and struggle with the subjective nuances of student writing. This thesis addresses these challenges by developing and practically validating a teacher-centered, rubric-guided AI support tool, an early-stage instantiation of hybrid interaction in educational assessment designed to assist, rather than replace, educator expertise. The system integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) into a rubric-based workflow, featuring staged score reveal, editable feedback, and evidence highlighting to preserve teacher agency and support the consistent application of rubric criteria compared to a single human reference. The system was iteratively designed through literature synthesis and formative research with educators, resulting in a set of empirically grounded design steps. Its effectiveness and usability were demonstrated through practical validation activities: a corpus-based grade comparison with a single expert human grader, and a comparative application in a workshop setting where experienced teachers graded essays both with and without AI support. Quantitative analyses examined the alignment between AI and human grades for structural rubric criteria, with the AI tending to assign slightly higher overall scores and showing lower reliability on more interpretive aspects. Qualitative feedback highlighted the tool’s value as a collaborator supporting workflow integration, reducing perceived cognitive effort, and maintaining transparency, while also underscoring the enduring importance of teacher oversight and professional judgment. This research contributes a teacher-centered framework for responsible AI integration in education, demonstrating that a thoughtfully designed support tool can assist in the consistent application of rubric criteria and in supporting a more structured grading workflow, while respecting teacher autonomy. The thesis also identifies current limitations and outlines concrete directions for future development, including batch grading, rubric calibration, local language models, and broader assessment contexts. Overall, the findings reinforce the role of AI as a supportive partner in educational assessment, complementing rather than supplanting the nuanced expertise of human educators.

108458,Strengthening Connections: Evaluating Citizen Preferences for Police Communication Channels,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108458,"Various communication channels are available for citizens to report incidents to the police, yet the factors guiding their channel selection remain unclear. The present study set out to investigate whether citizens’ internet skills and the type of case they wish to report to the police influence their communication channel preferences. Additionally, it examined whether participants would change their initial preferences after receiving additional information about the specific features associated with each channel. A scenario-based approach was employed in which participants (N= 137) were randomly assigned one of four written scenarios (i.e., bicycle theft, WhatsApp scam, domestic violence, or neighbour nuisance) and asked to report the case to the police. Participants selected their preferred communication channel from a list of options twice: once before and once after being presented with the features of each channel. After each selection, they were asked to write down their reasoning to provide additional context. Results showed that participants rarely changed their initial channel preferences, suggesting a pre-existing awareness of the respective features of each reporting method. Higher internet skills were also associated with a greater preference for digital channels. Additionally, the severity and emotionality of the case type emerged as a stronger determinant of channel preference, with more serious or emotionally charged cases prompting a preference for face-to-face communication channels.

108457,Bridging the Euro--Dollar Gap: An FX-Swap Hedging Framework for Semi-Public Development Finance Institutions,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108457,"Invest International, a Dutch semi-public development finance institution, funds in euros while a growing share of loans is projected to be in U.S. dollars, creating a structural FX mismatch. In this thesis, we design and evaluate a non-speculative, auditable EUR/USD FX-swap framework that hedges each USD disbursement in full via rolling six-month swaps. The treasury solution pairs (i) a deterministic Excel valuation engine for month-end MTM and audit trails, with (ii) a stochastic module that simulates joint EUR and USD short-rates and the implied FX spot under Hull–White one-factor dynamics; a two-factor variant is used for robustness. Calibrations rely on ECB and Federal Reserve zero curves, LSEG swaption vols, and ECB spot fixings. Monte Carlo bond prices match analytical values within 0.1%. In a historical backtest for a USD 1 million exposure, the hedge cuts six-month P&L volatility from 3.9% to 0.29% of notional and reduces VaR95 from €67k to €12.7k. Crisis-size one-week shocks (+10.6%/−7.2%) leave median eight-year cumulative hedge P&L around −3% to +14%, though the 5th percentile remains near −45%.

108456,Shaping Consumer Perception and Future Purchase Intention: The Impact of Retailers' Aggressive vs. Informative Buy-Now-Pay-Later Marketing Approaches,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108456,"Objective: This study examined the impact of aggressive and informative marketing strategies used to promote Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services on consumer trust, loyalty, and future purchase intentions toward the retailer. By focusing on two contrasting communication styles, urgency-driven aggressive tactics and clarity-focused informative messaging, the study contributes to understanding how financial service promotions shape consumer–retailer relationships in retail settings.Method: An online experiment with a 2x2 between-subjects design was conducted. Participants selected a product category and viewed a banner ad reflecting one of four BNPL messaging conditions, then completed measures including brand trust, brand loyalty, and future purchase intentions.Results: Aggressive and informative BNPL messaging did not significantly affect consumers' trust, loyalty, or future purchase intentions toward the retailer. However, informative messaging influenced loyalty and purchase intentions among participants already familiar with the retailer.Theoretical implications: The findings suggest that the Elaboration Likelihood Model may not fully account for consumer responses in financial service marketing. Brand familiarity appears to be an important condition for processing BNPL information, while the lack of negative effects from urgency cues indicates that Reactance Theory may play out differently in retail contexts, where such tactics are often viewed as normal practice.Practical implications: Future research should test BNPL messaging across different shopping stages, formats, and timeframes. The results suggest that BNPL works best when paired with existing brand familiarity and presented clearly. Platforms like Klarna cansupport this by helping retailers align BNPL messaging with their audience’s existing expectations and recognition of the retailer.Conclusion: Most participants were unaffected by a single BNPL banner, with trust and loyalty toward the retailer largely unchanged. However, informative messaging was received more positively when the retailer was already familiar, suggesting that familiarity may shape how consumers respond to BNPL promotions.Keywords: BNPL, retail marketing, brand trust, brand loyalty, future purchasing intention",Master Communication Science (M-COM),"Leskovšek, N.",August 2025,English,"No.

108454,The adoption of MEAT criteria in public procurement,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108454,"Public procurement is increasingly recognized as a strategic instrument for promoting sustainability. The Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) criteria enable contracting authorities to move beyond cost-based evaluations. They do this by incorporating quality, environmental, and social considerations. However, limited quantitative evidence exists on the factors influencing the adoption of MEAT. This study addresses this gap through an empirical analysis of 51,881 procurement notices from the EU TED database. The five hypotheses were tested to assess the impact of tender complexity, sectoral context, environmental awareness, legislative change, and economic development on MEAT. The findings show that complexity rather facilitates than inhibits MEAT use. The tenders with more evaluation criteria allocate significantly less weight to price. There is a significant difference in MEAT adoption between sectors. Besides that, environmental awareness correlates negatively with MEAT usage. This indicates reliance on alternative sustainability instruments. In addition, the legislative reforms foster gradual rather than immediate adoption. Finally, economic development positively predicts MEAT usage, showing the importance of resource capacity.

While leadership communication is widely acknowledged as a critical aspect in melding workers' perceptions of their jobs, the significance of organizational documents in expressing job meaningfulness and role alignment is unexplored. Existing research focuses mostly on direct leader-employee interactions, frequently ignoring how formal documents impact employees' perceptions of their contributions to corporate performance. Given the growing complexity of the workplace, particularly with the advent of hybrid and remote work, it is vital to understand how employees perceive and interact with these documents. This study went over how employees interpret organizational papers, particularly mission and vision statements, as instruments for expressing job meaningfulness and role alignment. It aimed to reveal the importance of company leaders communicating organizational messages and employees comprehending these messaging. interpretating companies’ leaderships’ intentions and employees' comprehension of organizational messages by focusing on their interpretations. The result showed that clarity and visibility of these company statements as well as support by leadership behavior made employees more likely to feel aligned and motivated.

108449,Applying a Strengths-Based Approach in Multidisciplinary Teams: The Role of Line Managers in Enhancing Team Performance,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108449,"This thesis explores how a strengths-based approach is applied in multidisciplinary teams to enhance team performance. Multidisciplinary teams are composed of professionals from diverse functional backgrounds, and those teams are vital for innovation. However, they often face challenges such as communication issues, unclear role division, and conflicting priorities. A strengths-based approach can help overcome these challenges, because this approach focuses on identifying and utilizing the unique strengths of employees. Managers who implement the strengths-based approach, they recognize these strengths through informal observation and personal conversations, and assign tasks accordingly. This approach leads to increased motivation, greater ownership, improved collaboration, and ultimately, stronger team performance. The central research question is:How do line managers apply a strengths-based approach in multidisciplinary teams to enhance team performance? A qualitative research design was used in this investigation, involving five semi-structured interviews with line managers of multidisciplinary teams. Participants were selected based on their experience in managing those teams. The interviews were thematically analyzed using a combination of inductive and deductive coding in Atlas.ti. From the data, three main themes emerged, namely:recognizing strengths,utilizing strengths, andthe effects on team performance. Managers identified the strengths of their employees mainly through informal observations and having one-on-one conversations with them. Hereby, managers tailored tasks based on the strengths of the employees, created greater autonomy, and built mutual trust. These practices led to increased motivation, greater ownership, improved collaboration, and ultimately, stronger team performance. The conclusion is that a strengths-based approach positively impacts team performance, particularly in multidisciplinary teams. Managers can reduce friction and enhance collaboration in multidisciplinary teams, when they leverage the strengths of the individuals in their team. Previous researches show that the strengths-based approach individual well-being and engagement supports, while this study highlights how it helps line managers in multidisciplinary teams. These findings are relevant for organizations and HR professionals, because those findings show that focusing on strengths is beneficial for the employee well-being and is also a strategic tool for improving performance. One limitation of this study is that the data only reflects the perspective of line managers. Including team members in future research could offer a more complete understanding of how strengths-based practices are seen and felt within multidisciplinary teams. Additionally, most managers were unfamiliar with the term ""strengths-based approach"" itself, which may have limited the theoretical depth of the findings.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Katalanc, M.L.",August 2025,English,"No

108442,Green Public Procurement in Healthcare: A Comparative Analysis of Green Award Criteria Integration in EU Public Notices for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Equipment,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108442,"As healthcare systems confront increasing environmental challenges and the pressing need for sustainability, public procurement has become a crucial policy tool. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems, known for their high energy consumption and complex life cycles, pose significant environmental impacts. It is therefore worthwhile to understand how these devices are procured and how much environmental considerations are involved in the process. This thesis investigates the integration of green public procurement (GPP) criteria in the acquisition of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) equipment across European Union (EU) member states, focusing on how environmental considerations are embedded within contract award decisions. Procurement notices are a valuable data source because they offer direct insight into how policy priorities such as sustainability are operationalized in real-world purchasing decisions based on the award criteria. To explore this, the study analyzes procurement notices published on the EU’s official procurement platform. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the study combines quantitative content analysis of 1,085 procurement notices from the EU’s Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) database (2016-2024) with comparative policy analysis across a few member states. Results reveal that although the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) model which is a procurement approach that allows contracts to be awarded based not solely on price, but also on other qualitative factors such as sustainability, lifecycle cost, and innovation dominates (66.5% of notices), only 18.4% of MRI tenders explicitly incorporate environmental or green criteria. Furthermore, when green criteria are applied, they are often modestly weighted (typically 10-15%), limiting their practical impact. Cross-national differences in GPP implementation are linked to variations in institutional capacity, economic constraints, and policy commitment. The analysis examined variations in practices across EU countries and potential barriers to sustainability.

While involving patients is increasingly recognized as valuable, researchers often face obstacles such as limited experience and uncertainty about its benefits. Eight researchers who considered their experiences with patient participation successful were interviewed. They highlighted advantages at different levels: more relevant research questions, clearer outcome measures, and improved communication on a substantive level; more feasible study protocols and easier recruitment on a procedural level; and increased motivation and awareness of societal relevance on a personal level. Success was fostered by mutual trust, transparent communication, flexibility, and challenging assumptions about patients’ contributions. The findings suggest that patient participation can strengthen research quality and create meaningful impact when carefully integrated and supported by organizations. However, if conditions such as clear roles, sufficient resources, and organizational backing are lacking, participation risks becoming symbolic or burdensome for patients.

108436,Assessing the Impact of a Kinematic-Moment Multitask Learning Model on Joint Angle Accuracy via Inverse Dynamics from a Sparse Sensor Set,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108436,"Introduction:Joint angles (JA) estimated from inertial measurement units (IMU) are commonly used as input for inverse dynamics (ID) to compute joint moments (JM). However, conventional pipelines treat kinematic and kinetic estimation as separate tasks, often overlooking how errors in JA predictions propagate to ID-derived JMs. This study investigates whether integrating JM estimation into the training process of a kinematic model through a multitask learning (MTL) model can improve JA quality that improves downstream JM accuracy when using OpenSim ID. Methods:The MTL model consists of a kinematic estimation (KE) and a moment estimation (ME) model. The models are based on the LSTM network and use a min-max normalized RMSE loss function. Data from three IMUs (pelvis and shanks) and pressure insoles were used for ML and OpenSim ID. Performance was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation and ensemble averaging. Performance metrics included RMSE and Pearson’s𝑟for 21 JAs and 20 OpenSim ID-derived JMs. Results:Both the KE and KE&ME models under performed in JA estimation compared to the reference. However, both the KE and the KE&ME models achieved improved JM estimation compared to the reference. Ensemble averaging slightly significantly improved performance across all speeds. Discussion:Worse JA estimation performance compared to reference was probably due to modifications to the ML architecture. However, improved JM estimation appears mainly due to a min–max normalization in the loss function, which equalized learning between outputs of different magnitudes and probably facilitated a more consistent estimation of JAs. Although the multitask KE&ME model was conceptually appealing, it did not outperform the KE model in OpenSim ID performance, suggesting limited added value from joint training in this context. Conclusion:Joint training of JAs and JMs using an MTL approach is feasible, but did not improve over a well-optimized KE model for ID purposes. Loss normalization was a key contributor to improved JM estimation. Future efforts may benefit from assigning differential weights to individual JA outputs, allowing the model to prioritize more influential angles for ID while preserving general accuracy Master Biomedical Engineering (M-BME) UT research group(s)",,"Dijkstra, C.G.",August 2025,English,"No

The present study explores passenger expectations of and experiences with AT operations, particularly at grade of automation (GoA) Levels 3 and 4. A two-phase, mixed-method approach was adopted. Phase 1 involved a systematic literature review that identified key factors influencing passenger acceptance. Phase 2 involved a pilot study using a virtual reality (VR) train simulation and a literature-informed survey in a 2 x 2 between-subjects design, where 20 participants were randomly assigned to either a smooth or bumpy ride condition. Because the sample was small, statistically significant effects were not expected; nor were they found, though some trends were identified. For instance, previous autonomous system experience was linked to moderately higher trust; frequent train travellers reported slightly greater intention to use ATs; smooth and bumpy rides were attributed to a presumed human driver; and higher risk tolerance shifted preferences from low (GoA1–2) towards full automation (GoA4). Qualitative feedback from participants highlighted shortfalls in the simulation: audio cues (such as announcements), matching haptic-motion cues, fellow passengers, and varied scenery. The study, the first to present a VR driving simulator framework for AT research, provides quantitative evidence linking risk attitude to automation acceptance and suggests how to improve the simulation.

This study explores multiple color correction and calibration methods to ensure consistent reagent interpretation under varying lighting conditions. The goal is to evaluate whether these color correction techniques can achieve clinically relevant performance in identifying UTI biomarkers, specifically nitrite and leukocyte esterase, across different dipstick brands. Four dipstick brands (Macherey-Nagel, Analyticon 11SYS PLUS, Analyticon 12SYS PLUS, Roche) were evaluated using five different correction strategies: No Correction, Gray World, White Patch, ColorChecker Passport Photo2, In-Image Direct Comparison. Dipstick images were captured at the MST laboratory using urine samples collected from Urimon study participants (ages 45 to 75) and Unilabs. In-Image Direct Comparison, which leverages reference label colors embedded in the image background (color chart), achieved the highest overall performance for the Analyticon strips. Reaction time was shown to affect diagnostic performance, particularly for leukocyte detection. Linearity and distance analysis demonstrated the potential for interpolating numerical reagent values, but also revealed limitations due to minimal color separation between adjacent labels. Although promising, the result varied across dipstick brands, and clinical applicability was constrained by the known chemical limitations of Nitrite in Analyticon strips. Based on these findings, a custom reference color chart is designed for Roche strips to extend comparison within the image methods to other dipstick brands.

108425,SELECTING AND BENCHMARKING A SUSTAINABILITY RATIO: COMBINING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF A COMPANY,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108425,"The growing importance of sustainability in corporate decision-making has highlighted the need for standardized and transparent reporting mechanisms. This study examines the feasibility and impact of implementing a universal sustainability ratio that integrates financial performance with environmental impact. By benchmarking this ratio, the research aims to improve comparability across industries, enhance corporate accountability, and support informed decision-making by investors, regulators, and other stakeholders. ·Need for Standardization: Sustainability reporting remains fragmented due to varying frameworks such as GRI, SASB, and CSRD. A universal sustainability ratio would address these inconsistencies and enhance comparability. ·Sector-Specific Considerations: While a universal ratio improves transparency, industry-specific benchmarks are necessary to account for sectoral differences in environmental impact. ·Assurance and Verification: Many sustainability reports lack independent verification, reducing their credibility. Third-party assurance would enhance trust and reliability. ·Corporate Implementation Challenges: Adoption of sustainability ratios depends on their ease of calculation and interpretation. Providing clear guidelines and regulatory support would encourage widespread use. The study concludes that a universal sustainability ratio has the potential to improve corporate transparency and accountability, but its effectiveness depends on standardization, sector-specific benchmarks, and independent assurance mechanisms. While companies recognize the importance of sustainability metrics, regulatory enforcement and clear implementation strategies are essential for ensuring their meaningful adoption. Future research should focus on refining the ratio, expanding its application across industries, and assessing its long-term impact on corporate behavior and sustainability performance.",Master Industrial Engineering and Management (M-IEM),"Gerritsma, B.",September 2025,English,"No.

108424,Assessing Bridge Circularity and Environmental Impact at the End-of-Life Stage: The Life Cycle Circularity Index,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108424,"The construction sector plays a critical role in advancing circular economy principles, particularly in addressing the high volumes of construction and demolition waste generated at the end-of-life (EoL) stage of bridges. This study proposes the Life Cycle Circularity Index (LCCI), an indicator that integrates life cycle assessment with an adapted construction circularity EoL indicator to evaluate and compare the circularity and environmental impacts of EoL strategies for bridges. The method is demonstrated through a case study of the KW21 viaduct in the Netherlands, assessing four EoL scenarios. LCCI was found to be more sensitive to the reuse-to-recycling mass ratio than to transport distance. By consolidating environmental and circularity assessment into a single framework, LCCI enables the identification of potential trade-offs, alignment of assessment boundaries, and reduction of uncertainties related to long service lifespans in EoL assessments. Its applicability extends across different bridge types, although outcomes remain influenced by data quality, availability, and contextual conditions such as virgin material costs. Further refinement is recommended to incorporate uncertainty analysis and to improve the differentiation between recycling and downcycling. The findings support LCCI as a practical decision-support indicator for integrating circular economy principles in bridge projects and highlight its potential to be adapted for other infrastructure types, life cycle phases, and LCIA methods.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"Feng, Y.",August 2025,English,"No.

Over the years this theory has been expanded, revised and criticised. One part of the critiques it received pertained to the apparent exclusion of women from the existing literature. On the one hand critics brought up the question of whether authentic leadership might look differently for women and theorised that they might face hurdles that men do not. On the other hand, some research has shown women as capable and successful leaders when employing different types of leadership. This might bring one to believe that women will be able to re-create this success when it comes to authentic leadership. The aim of this paper is an initial exploration of the topic of women as authentic leaders. It aims to create an insight into what female leaders might define as authentic and whether they are able to operationalise what is written in the literature or if it might constitute a significant issue for them.

108419,Moral Responsibility and AI Extractivism: A STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF AI SUPPLY CHAINS,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108419,"AI ethics, despite its heterogeneous voices and perspectives, can fall short due to its principlisticorientation that only fixates on the technical aspects of the technology. This has resulted in shifts oftheorising that not only acknowledge the technology’s sociotechnical embeddedness but also its structuralaspects. With theorists hailing the structural turn in AI ethics, AI is being recognised as a globalassemblage of natural resources, human labour and data from all around the world. However, the supplychains that funnel the resources for AI development result in a range of extractivist harms. And sincethese issues are beyond the boundaries of a single company entangled in a complex web made up ofseveral supply chains, the problem of ‘many hands’ gets amplified on a global scale, yet has adisproportionate effect on the Majority World, with historical, complicating notions of moralaccountability. Hence, the primary research question of this project is: how should one attribute moralresponsibilities for the structural injustices involving extractivism across AI supply chains? To answer thisquestion, this project borrows approaches from critical AI studies and philosophical literature onstructural injustice, engaging in applied philosophy. After highlighting that the resources used in AIdevelopment are sourced through and uphold an extractive logic, I argue that AI ethics must acknowledgethat the infrastructural harms, emerging from natural resource excavation, and exploitative harms,emerging from labour exploitation, are undivorced from the algorithmic harms as they are rooted in thesame structure. I analyse these harms through the typologies of structural injustice outlined by Young(2011) and McKeown (2024b), to infer that natural resource extraction for AI development is a case ofavoidable structural injustice, due to the foresseability of the harm of the mineral excavation and thatlabour exploitation for AI development is a case of deliberate structural injustice, as the structures thatresult in these harms are deliberately maintained. Furthermore, I argue that agents with power can beattributed moral responsibility for these structural injustices, as they can maintain, influence, and disruptthe structure that reproduces injustices. By tracing power through the supply chains and finding itconcentrated at the downstream tier, I conclude that multinational corporations can be held morallyresponsible for the structural injustices involving extractivism across AI supply chains, due to the powerthey have in influencing and maintaining structures that result in injustice. Hence, positioning myselfwithin the power-conscious structural turn in AI ethics, I argue for moral accountability by MNCs for theextractivist harms emerging from AI production and hint at the additional importance of the ordinaryindividual's political responsibility in bringing about structural change, also suggesting AI minimisationin terms of scale and necessity.","Master Philosophy of Science, Technology and Society (M-PSTS)","Sharma, D.",August 2025,English,"No

108418,"Multi-Objective Optimisation of Two-Echelon Distribution Networks with Flexible Flows: Balancing Cost, Service, and Sustainability",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108418,"This study develops a multi-objective optimisation model to support strategic decisions in distribution network design, where companies need to balance logistics costs, service performance, and sustainability. The model is formulated as a two-echelon Hierarchical Facility Location Problem (HFLP) with flexible flows, extending existing HFLP literature by addressing cost, service, and emission objectives simultaneously in an exact Mixed-Integer Linear Programming framework. Flexible flows allow goods to be shipped either directly from the central warehouse to customers or indirectly via regional Distribution Centers, enabling allocation decisions that are not constrained to fixed routing structures. The three objectives—cost, service level, and CO2 emissions—are integrated into a weighted-sum formulation, facilitating a transparent trade-off analysis across different strategic priorities. The model was validated against a commercial network design tool and applied to a real-world case study, supported by sensitivity analyses on demand growth, transportation cost changes, and emission reductions. The results demonstrate that the model enables a structured evaluation of trade-offs and helps identify efficient network configurations under different strategic priorities. In the case study, adding two regional DCs reduced costs by about 10%, cut emissions by 13%, and shortened average delivery distance by more than 40% compared to the current network. Sensitivity analysis showed that regional demand growth strongly influenced DC selection, while transport cost changes mainly affected larger, more decentralised networks. Reductions in emission factors mainly reduced absolute emissions without altering network structure.",Master Industrial Engineering and Management (M-IEM),"Turkstra, D.",August 2025,English,"Yes

108416,QUANTIFYING THE EFFECT OF TURBULENT INFLOW FIELDS ON WIND TURBINE PERFORMANCE,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108416,"In the design and development process of an offshore wind turbine, experimental and numerical tests are crucial for assessing its performance. Due to the inherent simplifications in experimental and numerical models, the prediction of wind turbine performance with a model-scale wind turbine can never include every aspect of a real-life scenario. The uncertainties in the results of measurements and numerical simulations, and the impact that parameters have on the predictions of the performance of the wind turbine, are established by a so-called uncertainty quantification analysis. In this thesis, an uncertainty quantification analysis will be carried out for both a full-scale and a model-scale scenario. The full-scale setup of simulations consisted of a variety of turbulent inflow fields generated with the stochastic turbulent wind field generator software TurbSim (developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory). The results showed that high turbulent inflow fields gave higher power output, except near the rated wind speed, where higher velocities in the distribution are cut off by the control mechanism of the wind turbine. At model scale, MARIN utilizes a scale model of the IEA 15MW turbine in their offshore basin. The geometry, properties, and control configuration were translated to numerical simulation tool QBlade. As MARIN is investigating the stability of offshore floating structures, the rotor thrust force is the most important performance metric. The model scale wind turbine intends to match thrust force data from the offshore basin. Consequently, a variety of custom model scale turbulent inflow fields (inspired by the wind field generation in the offshore basin) were used on this turbine.  On these results, different surrogate models were built and cross-validated. It was concluded that a Gaussian Process Regression model in combination with a rational-quadratic kernel performed with the smallest error.",Master Mechanical Engineering (M-ME),"Navis, E.A.",August 2025,English,"No

This study investigated the differential impact of Text-based versus Video-based pre-training on learner attention and subsequent performance in a complex VR-based road construction task. A sample of 37 novice participants was randomly assigned to one of two instructional conditions (Text-based, n=19; Video-based, n=18) before engaging in a 10-minute VR asphalt-rolling simulation. Task performance was measured across three components (quality, violations, productivity), and overt visual attention was measured using eye-tracking. The primary statistical analysis focused on comparing the Text-based (n=19) and Video-based (n=18) conditions. A MANOVA revealed no statistically significant overall difference in performance between the groups. Follow-up exploratory tests on the individual performance components also showed no significant differences. However, the instructional mode did have a significant effect on thepatternof visual attention. The Text-based group made significantly more fixations (p= .003) and was significantly faster to fixate on relevant information (p< .001) than the Video-based group. No significant correlations were found between any attention metric and any aspect of task performance. An additional exploratory analysis revealed that the dominant strategy a participant adopted was a significant predictor of performance quality and violation rate, independent of the instructional condition. These results suggest that for novice learners engaging with a complex VR task, the mode of instruction may have a greater impact on the pattern of visual behaviour than on performance outcomes, and that text-based instructions elicit a visual pattern consistent with the cognitive demands of reading. Besides a complex motor skill in VR, the individual's strategic approach to the task may be a more powerful determinant of success than the modality of the pre-training instruction.",Master Educational Science and Technology (M-EST),"Parsapour, F.",August 2025,English,"No

Using a stratified sampling approach and longitudinal panel data, the research examines whether CISO presence influences three key financial performance indicators: Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and Tobin’s Q. Four hypotheses are tested, addressing direct performance effects, the moderating role of regulatory pressure, firm size association, and financial performance volatility. Results show no significant overall improvement in financial outcomes from CISO presence across all industries, but reveal substantial heterogeneity: positive effects in some sectors (e.g., manufacturing) and negative associations in others (e.g., wholesale trade). Regulatory environments further shape these outcomes, with CISOs linked to stronger shareholder value in moderately regulated sectors but weaker results in highly regulated industries. Larger firms are significantly more likely to adopt CISOs, and their presence is associated with reduced volatility in ROA and Tobin’s Q, enhancing stability rather than short-term profitability. The findings extend the Resource-Based View by positioning CISOs as strategic governance assets whose financial impact depends on contextual factors.

This study investigates why employees in Dutch innovation teams avoid or engage in task conflicts. A qualitative research design was applied, using semi-structured interviews with eleven participants from diverse innovation-oriented organizations. Thematic analysis identified four main themes of conflict avoidance motives: individual-level (e.g. fear of negative consequences, cost-benefit analysis, self-doubt), dyadic-level (e.g. relationship quality, relational tension during conflict), team-level (e.g. group dynamics and group setting, harmony preservation), and organizational-level (e.g. leadership behaviour, authority/expertise, strategic silence and professional image management). Task conflict engagement motives were also identified, including individual readiness for conflict, interpersonal trust and relationship quality, and setting the stage for task conflicts. The findings contribute to existing research in two ways. First, the Dual-Concern Model originally positions task conflict avoidance as low concern for self and others. However, this study’s findings suggest that task conflict avoidance can also reflect high concern for self (e.g. self-protection, image management) or high concern for others (e.g. preserving harmony, protecting relationships). Secondly, task conflict avoidance is often influenced by multiple individual, dyadic, team, and organizational factors at the same time, rather than by isolated factors alone.

108401,Validating the EmbracePlus Smartwatch for measuring Electrodermal Activity and Stress Assessment in Virtual Reality: The Moderating Role of Presence,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108401,"Smartwatches are increasingly used for stress monitoring, but their validation in immersive and ecologically valid settings remains limited. This study evaluated the EmbracePlus smartwatch’s ability to measure electrodermal activity, in particular the skin conductance level during three virtual reality stress tasks and examined whether the subjective sense of presence influences device agreement.A within-subjects design was employed with 20 healthy adults.Skin conductance level was measured using both the EmbracePlus and a reference device. A modified validation protocol was applied, assessing signal-level agreement through cross-correlation and parameter-level agreement using Bland and Altman analysis. Results indicated weak correlations between devices, with the EmbracePlus underestimating skin conductance level compared to the reference device. While both devices detected increased arousal during stress phases, presence did not significantly predict physiological changes or improve agreement. These findings emphasize the need for improved accuracy in wearable stress sensors and greater consistency in validation practices. Importantly, this study successfully applied a validation protocol developed by the broader Stress in Action project team, providing preliminary evidence that immersive environments can be used to systematically evaluate wearable stress sensors under ecologically valid conditions.

108400,Understanding Consumer Brand Engagement in Virtual Brand Communities,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108400,"This thesis explores consumer brand engagement (CBE) within virtual brand communities (VBCs) on Instagram and TikTok. It examines how platform-specific features, consumer motivations, and success factors influence engagement, based on a multi-theoretical framework. This framework includes Media Richness Theory to understand platform features, Uses and Gratifications, and Self-Determination theories to explain user motivations. The Stimulus–Organism–Response (S-O-R) paradigm integrates success factors, leading to the development of a comprehensive model of CBE in social media contexts. A quantitative survey (N = 184) of members of fashion brand communities on both platforms was conducted, with data analyzed through multiple regression analysis. Additionally, multiple-group comparisons and tests of mediation and moderation were used to examine platform differences and interaction effects. Results:The findings reveal that intrinsic user motivations, specifically entertainment, self-expression, and social connection, are the primary drivers of CBE on both Instagram and TikTok. These internal factors have significant positive effects, while platform-specific features (such as interactive tools and personalization options) and success factors (like brand trust, user satisfaction, and perceived community quality) do not exert a significant direct impact on engagement in terms of motivations. However, mediation analysis shows that these platform features influence engagement indirectly: each feature has a significant indirect effect on CBE through users’ motivational gratifications. This indicates that robust social media features boost engagement mainly by fulfilling users’ intrinsic needs rather than through direct mechanical effects. Regarding moderation, cross-platform comparisons demonstrate that both platforms employ a shared engagement mechanism. The only platform-specific element, symbolic communication, exerts a significantly stronger influence on CBE within the Instagram community, reflecting Instagram’s visually curated environment. Conversely, the links between intrinsic motivations and engagement do not differ notably between Instagram and TikTok, highlighting the consistent significance of these motivations across both platforms. Contributions:This study advances CBE theory by confirming that intrinsic motivations are the primary drivers of engagement, even on fast-paced, visually oriented social platforms. It broadens the existing literature through a comprehensive analysis connecting technological features with psychological motivations, showing that platform features alone do not guarantee engagement unless they are used to meet users’ needs. The multi-theoretical framework employed in this thesis offers a detailed understanding of how user motivations and platform design interact to influence engagement. Practically, the findings provide valuable insights for social media marketing and community management: brands should develop platform-specific strategies (e.g., visual content on Instagram, participatory entertainment on TikTok) based on key consumer motivations. By aligning content and interactive elements with users’ desires for fun, self-expression, and social connection, marketers can foster more meaningful engagement within online brand communities. Overall, this research enhances both theoretical and practical knowledge on creating effective brand engagement amid the evolving landscape of Instagram and TikTok VBCs.

While publicly available sources such as news articles, blogs, and social media posts can contribute crucial details, these accounts often vary in reliability, structure, and narrative consistency. This project introduces Arachne, a experiental tool designed to support investigators in analyzing and reasoning over conflicting OSINT data using a knowledge graph-based interface. Built with Neo4j as the database solution and visualized through a Streamlit frontend, Arachne restructures relational database data into a property graph model that preserves narrative context and highlights interrelations between key investigative elements. The system utilizes Elementary Scenario Components (ESCs) to encode case details into interpretable clusters and provides interactive tools for querying, filtering, and visually aligning data relevant to criminological theories. Compared to traditional spreadsheet-based methods, Arachne enables more intuitive navigation, source traceability, and theory-driven analysis—demonstrated through a hypothetical case study. Although some features such as theory embedding and comparative case views remain exploratory, the tool demonstrates the applicability of knowledge graphs for narrative-informed OSINT analysis.

In response to national efforts aimed at agricultural modernization, Rwanda has adopted LSLA initiatives to enhance productivity and economic resilience. However, these interventions raise critical questions regarding their impacts on local food production, infrastructure, socio-economic livelihoods, and land tenure security. Using a mixed-methods approach, this research combines semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, field observations, and satellite imagery to analyze the changes experienced by landowners, non-landowners, and local leaders. The findings reveal that while LSLA has introduced new crop types and improved farming techniques, especially in demonstrating the full benefits of increased production, these have not yet been realized by most community members due to delays in irrigation infrastructure. Socioeconomic impacts are evident, with LSLA contributing to more stable employment opportunities and diversified income sources for both landowners and non-landowners. Additionally, the project has led to significant infrastructure development, including roads, irrigation canals, electricity supply, and model villages, all of which support improved agricultural productivity. The study finds that LSLA has brought more positive than negative impacts, particularly in crop diversification, employment, and infrastructure development. However, delays in irrigation have limited food production on farmers’ land, and some landowners are still waiting for formal land titles for their relocated land, which affects their ability to access bank credit. Ensuring timely irrigation, securing land titles, and maintaining local food access during project implementation are essential for the long-term success of LSLA in Rwanda.",Master Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (M-GEO-WO),"Uwamariya, J.",July 2025,English,"No

This research proposes a robust pipeline that combines YOLOv8 and Ultralytics' image classification models for detection and classification tasks, respectively. Existing datasets lack representation of damaged HAZMAT placards. Thus, we utilised traditional augmentation techniques and a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) based model to simulate damaged HAZMAT placards. To generate realistic chipping and tearing of the HAZMAT placard, we have collected our HAZMATDefect-CT dataset in a similar setting to the HAZMAT-13 dataset. We have trained and tested multiple detection models and R-HazNet (Robust HAZMAT Network) with four different combinations of datasets: 1) State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) datasets, 2) SOTA datasets plus traditionally augmented data (TADS), 3) SOTA datasets + TADS + GAN-generated data, and 4) SOTA datasets + GAN-generated data. We utilised the DB wagon dataset collected in an industrial environment of EU cargo rails as our test dataset. R-HazNet trained on SOTA datasets with TADS and GAN-generated data outperformed other models, including the existing models, with a F1 score of 86.51%.

To address the uncertainty many FTMs face when selecting a pump, a two-phase approach was employed. First, a content analysis of Instagram and Shopee listings from two leading Indonesian breast pump brands (Spectra and Mom Uung) identified commonly used technological and emotional product messages. These were then used to create four packaging variations. In the second phase, a 2x2 between-subjects experiment randomly exposed Indonesian FTMs to one of four packaging types: technological, emotional, mixed, or control. Responses were collected via an online questionnaire. The factorial ANOVA revealed no significant main or interaction effects of message type on PPE or PI. However, exploratory analyses showed a general preference for technological messages across participants. Additionally, individual characteristics such as motherhood status, prior usage experience, and education level significantly shaped participants’ overall evaluations, with pregnant, less experienced, and lower- educated mothers reporting higher PPE scores. These findings suggest that message effectiveness may depend less on the type of message itself, and more on the personal background of the target audience.

The initiatives areEuropean-wide movements aiming to increase political participation in climate policies byengaging citizens and policymakers to find solutions for a sustainable future. Urgent climateactions are needed, but an increase in political polarization and public distrust in EU institutionshas slowed the implementation of effective policies. Rather than imposing decisions withoutthe involvement of citizens and risking further disengagement, inclusive participation shouldbe prioritized to strengthen democratic legitimacy. The central research question of this studyis: In what ways do citizen initiatives influence political legitimacy in the implementation ofthe European Green Deal? A qualitative approach is used, relying on deductive documentanalyses as a primary method. Atlas.ti is used as a research tool to aid the analysis. Thedocument analysis includes official EU documents on the Green Deal published in 2023/2024and reports created by the Real Deal project and the European Movement International. Linkingpolitical participation and legitimacy, this study will examine the extent to which politicalparticipation strengthens or weakens governance legitimacy by comparing theoreticalexpectations with practical outcomes. The theoretical framework draws on Scharpf’s conceptsof input and output legitimacy, also considering Schmidt’s idea of throughput legitimacy.Political participation is conceptualized by applying Van Deth’s framework as a typology tounderstand how different forms of engagement influence legitimacy.

In contrast, this study adopts an EU-wideperspective, providing insights into political participation on a supranational level in which thedecision-making process includes more stakeholders and impacts multiple member states. Awider scope enhances the understanding of political participation and democratic legitimacy intransnational governance structures.

Important sources of social support for students are peers, teachers, and academic advisors due to their potential beneficial effects against perceived stress and their supporting factor for student resilience. This study hypothesized that higher levels of peer support, teacher support, and academic advisor support would be associated with lower perceived stress in university students, and that resilience would have a moderating effect on these associations. This study used cross-sectional survey data from Dutch university and applied sciences students, gathered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings showed that both peer support and teacher support were significantly negatively related to perceived stress, but no significant effects were found for academic advisor support. Resilience was found to only moderate the relationship between peer support and perceived stress. Further analysis showed peer support being more beneficial in reducing perceived stress for students with lower resilience rather than for those with higher resilience.

108387,Identifying and balancing the optimal shift length for Home Health Care workers,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108387,"The increasing demand for home care services, combined with a global shortage of care workers, puts growing pressure on effective scheduling and workforce management. A major challenge lies in the large variationin shift lengths, which leads to income instability, stress and eventually care workers leaving the home care sector. This study addresses the question: How can shift lengths be balanced for care workers in Home Careto improve nurse satisfaction? To tackle this problem, three models are developed. The Home Health Care Scheduling Shift Length Problem (HHCSSLP) schedules care workers to patient requests while balancing shift durations, respecting time windows, skill requirements, travel times and shift length limits. The model is extended by the Home Health Care Routing and Scheduling Shift Length Problem (HHCRSSLP), which integrates routing and timing decisions. To solve larger instances where exact methods become computationally infeasible, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) metaheuristic is introduced. This heuristic iteratively improves solutions using destroy and repair strategies, adaptive heuristic weights and simulated annealing acceptance criteria. Experiments on multiple test instances show that the HHCSSLP yields high-quality solutions with short runtimes, but its scalability is limited to medium-sized instances. For example, in instance set D (25 patients,10 care workers) it achieves an average optimality gap of 2% but requires the full one-hour runtime. The HHCRSSLP struggles with computational performance, even for smaller cases. The ALNS proves capableof generating feasible and balanced schedules within limited runtimes (95 seconds for small sets up to 800 seconds for large ones). In terms of cost, it performs nearly as well as the exact model: the average laborcost differs by only €21.31. However, the ALNS produces more slack, with each care worker working on average 83 minutes fewer hours over the time horizon compared to the HHCSSLP. This research demonstrates that balancing shift durations in home care scheduling is both feasible and beneficial. Optimization models and metaheuristics can effectively contribute to fairer workload distributionand potentially improve care worker retention.

108386,Factors that determine the adoption of cloud computing by Dutch SMEs,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108386,"Cloud computing is widely recognized as a key enabler of digital transformation, offering significant benefits in efficiency, flexibility, and scalability, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Yet, despite these advantages, the structural adoption and integration of cloud services among Dutch SMEs remains uneven. This study seeks to understand which factors drive not only the initial adoption of cloud technologies but also their structural, embedded use within SMEs. Guided by an integrated framework combining the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Technology–Organization–Environment (TOE), Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory, and the Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM), the research employs a mixed-methods design centered on qualitative interviews with SME decision-makers and supporting surveys completed by both the SME representatives and their accountants. The results reveal that initial adoption is motivated primarily by Perceived Usefulness, relative advantage, and external pressures, and these factors are cited consistently across all organizations, regardless of adoption maturity. Therefore, these same factors do not explain differences in the depth of structural adoption. Instead, the study finds that only SMEs classified in the highest level of adoption maturity demonstrate ongoing, evolving goal-setting, continuous development, and critical self-assessment of digital maturity. This study reveals that most SMEs do not set measurable objectives and often overestimate their cloud integration, as shown by a consistent gap between self-assessment and external evaluation. Since Confirmation of initial Expectations is nearly universal, it cannot be the factor that distinguishes advanced adopters from others. The study concludes that moving beyond initial adoption to structural integration requires a shift from treating cloud migration as a one-off technical upgrade to an ongoing, strategically managed process. Practical recommendations highlight the need for tailored guidance and ongoing support from accountants, as well as flexible, evolving goals for SMEs.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Donderwinkel, J.",August 2025,English,"No

108384,"Public Procurement and MEAT Criteria: An Empirical Analysis Across Sectors, Regions, and Tender Types in the Netherlands",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108384,"Abstract In recent years, public procurement has evolved from a cost-driven process into astrategic policy instrument for promoting sustainability, innovation, and social value. This study investigates how the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) criteria are implemented in Dutch public procurement, and which factors influence their adoption and weighting. Drawing on a dataset of 4,957 tenders published in the Netherlands between 2021 and 2023, the research applies a combination of non-parametric tests and regression analyses to identify sectoral, regional, and organisational patterns in MEAT usage. The findings show that MEAT criteria are widely used, with quality emerging as the dominant non-price factor. However, the inclusion of sustainability and innovation remains limited. Significant variation is found across sectors, provinces, and types of contracting authorities. Urban tenders and national agencies are more likely to prioritise non-price elements, while high contract value and complexity are positively associated with the use of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. Contrary to expectations, SMEs were more likely to win tenders that were both complex and heavily weighted on non-price dimensions, suggesting that complexity does not necessarily deter SME participation. The study contributes to the academic literature by empirically demonstrating how contextual and institutional factors shape procurement behaviour, in line with theories of public value and institutional governance. In practical terms, it provides evidence-based recommendations for contracting authorities and policymakers, such as the development of standardised templates, targeted training, and simplified procedures to support SME inclusion.

Also, this is a follow-up project to a landmine detection project using UAVs and thermal cameras, and excavation is the step after detection in the demining process. The report shows the design and teleoperation of a UGV with a robotic arm that can dig in different post-conflict soils to uncover landmines safely, efficiently, and with intuitive controls for the operator. For the teleoperation, a hand-tracking device is used because such devices are said to be intuitive for complex tasks, and limited research has been conducted with them on real-life applications. Therefore, the ROS2 teleoperation program is described along with the hardware setup needed to make it work.The UGV was designed but not manufactured, so it was not possible to evaluate whether the robot could operate in post-conflict soils. Only certain requirements could be validated from the CAD model. However, a small-scale prototype of the robot was built, so the teleoperation could be evaluated through a series of tests. The experiments with users showed that the hand-tracking device can be successfully used to teleoperate a robot, but it was not used to its full complexity, which can explain why users found it easy and convenient to use. Moreover, this device is compared to an Xbox One controller, because this is a standard and widely used telemanipulator. The results showed that, on average, the users performed tasks faster with the controller. But no significant difference could be found with the use of the hand-tracking device. This may be due to the limited amount of data being collected, and the fact that the full complexity of the hand-tracking device was not utilized.However, several users preferred the hand-tracking device over the video game controller for the digging task. They claimed that it was more intuitive to use, especially if new controls were added, for example, by using the fingers to actuate the end-effector. Therefore, there is potential for this device to be used in more complex teleoperation tasks. This report ends with a list of recommendations for future work. These include improving the hand gestures to be more intuitive, based on user feedback. Lowering the latency by reducing the number of applications used in the program. Implementing sensors into the robot to provide the operator with a correct immersion into the robot’s environment. And creating a user-friendly interface for the operator to know which actions they can perform, and give them visual feedback.

108379,Analyzing the correlation between the core stability and postural (a)symmetry during riding in equestrians by using IMU sensors,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108379,"Low back pain is a common injury among equestrians. The exact cause of it is still unclear, but it is assumed that it is caused by multiple factors. Some of these are lower core stability and an asymmetric posture during riding. In this research, it will be investigated if there is a correlation between the (a)symmetry in the posture of an equestrian while riding and their core stability next to the horse. To analyze the (a)symmetry in the posture of the rider, inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used. Two commonly used tests will be performed to measure both the endurance and the dynamic balance of core stability. For testing the endurance, the McGill’s Trunk Muscle Endurance Tests (further referred to as McGill’s test) will be used. To measure the dynamic balance, the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) will be used. If there is a correlation between the results of one or both of the core tests next to the horse and the (a)symmetry of the posture during riding, it can make it easier to detect low back pain in equestrians earlier, give better treatment, and maybe even prevent it.To analyze the correlation two research questions were made. (1) If the core test next to the horse is performed better, does the equestrian sit more symmetrical during riding? (2) If the core test shows a better/stronger side, does the equestrian lean more towards the same or the opposite side?Seven participants were included in this research, all of them performed the two core tests and rode a given protocol on the horse where their posture was analyzed by using IMUs. To see if there is a correlation between the outcome of the (a)symmetry of the posture during riding and either one or both of the two core tests, a Spearman test was performed.Between the SEBT and the (a)symmetry of the posture of an equestrian, no correlation has been found. For the McGill’s test a correlation has been found for the (a)symmetry of the posture during riding for both the amount of the asymmetry, as well as the side to which the equestrian is leaning towards. Therefore, performing the McGill’s test can already give an equestrian valuable insight into whether they are sitting asymmetrical during riding, which may increase their risk of developing low back pain.

108378,Can Implicit Self-Compassion Be Trained? Investigating the Effects of Cognitive Bias Modification on Implicit Self-Compassion and Rumination,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108378,"Self-compassion has been linked to positive outcomes in emotion regulation, including reduced rumination. However, the role of implicit self-compassion remains unclear. This study investigated whether implicit self-compassion is associated with rumination and whether it can be enhanced through cognitive bias modification (CBM). In a quasi-experimental pre–post design with a no-treatment control group, 32 participants completed a 3-day CBM training aimed at increasing implicit self-compassion. We hypothesised that higher baseline implicit self-compassion would predict lower rumination, that CBM would increase implicit self-compassion, and that this increase would reduce rumination. Results indicated that CBM successfully enhanced implicit self-compassion, but it was not related to rumination, and the intervention did not reduce rumination. These findings suggest that while implicit self-compassion can be modified through CBM, it may not function as a protective factor against rumination. Future research should clarify the construct validity of implicit self-compassion and explore its role in other emotional and behavioural outcomes.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Kayikcio, E.",August 2025,English,"No

This research explores how silver workers face this discrimination related to digital skills, and how companies can reduce the discrimination against them. The findings from this research reveal that discrimination is rarely direct but occurs through subtle exclusion. Mainly due to not getting chosen for certain trainings or projects, lack of tailored training or digital skills being to present in KPIs.

108375,Coupled Particle-Reactor Modeling of Core-Shell Hydrogel Sorbents for CO2 Capture in Fixed- and Fluidized Bed Reactors,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108375,"Increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere necessitate efficient carbon capture strategies. Core-shell hydrogel particles are amine based solid sorbents that can be applied in a chemical reactor to capture CO2 with a high capacity in a wide range of environments. Furthermore, they show low degradation, are mass manufacturable, and tunable in size and composition. Freeze-drying these particles creates a porous hydrogel core, which promotes the CO2 uptake. When these particles are steamed, water enters the pores, which enhances the CO2-amine reaction. Due to the water content, the steamed particles can only be applied in a fixed bed reactor. The dry particles can be used in a fluidized bed reactor, which has improved heat and mass transfer. A deeper understanding of these particles within their respective reactors is required to optimize their implementation. In this study, coupled particle-reactor models were developed to evaluate the spatio-temporal sorption behavior of steamed and dry particles in their corresponding reactor. These models take into account the diffusion-reaction behavior on the particle scale, and the imposed hydrodynamic and mass transfer effects on the reactor scale. The models enable: 1) observation of the diffusion-reaction dynamics at both particle and reactor scale; 2) investigation on the influence of particle and reactor parameters on the sorption behavior; 3) identification of major mass transfer resistances. On a particle-scale, the steamed particles outperformed the dry particles both in terms of equilibrium capacity and sorption speed. Increasing the reactor height led to CO2 concentration differences in particles at the bottom and top of the reactors, showing sub-optimal utilization at the top. Therefore, increasing the reactor height for industrial applications is recommended, as long as the inlet gas velocity is increased accordingly to ensure a sufficient gas distribution throughout the reactors. The sorption behavior of the steamed and dry particles on a reactor scale was mostly similar to that of the particle models, as the internal resistance in the particles was dominant compared to the resistances imposed by the reactors. Therefore, future work should focus on optimizing the steamed and dry particles to reduce their internal resistance. Overall, this research enhances the understanding of the diffusion-reaction dynamics of core-shell hydrogel sorbents at both particle and reactor scales, providing insights and guidelines for their further design and implementation.

108370,A methodology to build shared strategic vision in inter-organizational maintenance ecosystems,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108370,"Public infrastructure organizations often operate in inter-organizational ecosystems when managing and maintaining their assets, involving collaboration between public authorities and private contractors. While public authorities retain responsibility, execution is often outsourced to private contractors, requiring robust collaboration, clear accountability, and well-defined maintenance concepts. This setup introduces complexity due to differing goals, fragmented responsibilities, and the need for strategic alignment, making a shared vision essential for the continuous improvement of maintenance practices. Addressing these complexities is particularly relevant in the Netherlands given the urgent challenge of maintaining and upgrading ageing infrastructure.Despite the acknowledged importance of continuous improvement in maintenance management, the literature lacks structured approaches for establishing a shared strategic vision within inter-organizational ecosystems. To address this gap, this study develops and validates a participatory methodology for laying the foundation of a roadmap to continuously improving maintenance concepts by co-creating a shared strategic vision across organizational boundaries. Grounded in the Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP) and informed by the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) Spectrum of Public Participation, the research integrates stakeholder engagement, design thinking principles, and qualitative data analysis to define a methodology able to assess current capabilities, identify improvement opportunities and develop a shared strategic vision. The methodology comprises four sequential, stakeholder-centered steps: (1) Capability Assessment through semi-structured interviews and card-sorting techniques to diagnose the maturity of maintenance management capabilities and cluster improvement opportunities; (2) Opportunity Prioritization via an impact-effort survey and Action Priority Matrix to identify highleverage initiatives; (3) Shared Vision Co-Creation using design-thinking tools including worst-idea generation, forced connections, and convergent brainstorming to synthesize a unified strategic direction; and (4) Vision Formalization and Transfer, consolidating the outcomes into a reusable artefact and facilitation guide to enable autonomous replication and scaling across the inter-organizational ecosystem. The methodology was applied in a real-world case study involving Rijkswaterstaat (RWS), the Dutch public infrastructure agency and private contractors. This application yielded a validated Opportunity Framework comprising ten initiatives across five categories, a ranked portfolio of improvement themes, a co-created strategic vision for one opportunity, and a facilitation guide for scaling the approach to all the identified opportunities. The findings demonstrate that participatory visioning enhances strategic alignment, ownership, and capability development across organizational boundaries. This research provides a replicable structure for initiating strategic alignment and continuous improvement in maintenance management within inter-organizational ecosystems, offering both theoretical insights and practical tools for researchers and practitioners.To build on these results, the next step is to prioritize the remaining opportunity areas through facilitated dialogue and co-create shared strategic visions for each. While the co-created visions express shared ambition and strategic direction, they do not yet meetthe formal criteria for strategic objectives, such as those defined in the SAMP framework. Instead, they more closely resemble an asset management policy in line with ISO 55000. Translating these visions into SMART-formulated objectives is a critical next step in supporting implementation and alignment with strategic asset management practices. These visions should then be translated into concrete strategic plans with clear responsibilities and timelines. Ultimately, this process supports the development of a dynamic, collaboratively owned roadmap for continuous improvement in maintenance management.

In paediatric care, regular follow-up by dietitians and paediatricians is essential for monitoring growth, dietary adherence, and psychosocial well-being. As healthcare systems face increasing pressure, remote care is gaining attention as a complementary approach. However, little is known about the needs and preferences of children with celiac disease and their parents regarding its integration into existing care pathways. Objective:This study aimed to explore the needs and preferences of children with celiac disease and their parents regarding the integration of remote care into the current care pathway in the Netherlands. Methods:A qualitative study was conducted using 13 semi-structured interviews with paediatric CD patients and their parents. Interviews were thematically analysed using both inductive and deductive approaches, guided by the CeHRes roadmap for eHealth development. Results:Families were generally open to remote care as a complement to in-person consultations, particularly during stable phases of the disease. The openness was conditional, influenced by trust in healthcare relationships, the child’s developmental stage, and contextual factors. Valued features included age-appropriate design, support for child autonomy, ease of use, and options to involve a broader caregiving network. Preferred applications ranged from teleconsultations and educational modules to dietary support apps and peer-to-peer communication. Key concerns included usability, privacy, and the reliability of digital tools. Discussion/conclusion:Remote care is perceived as a flexible and supportive complement to paediatric celiac care, provided it is aligned with families’ emotional needs, preferences, and context. Hybrid models that combine personal contact with well-designed digital tools are most acceptable. The findings highlight the importance of trust, flexibility, and relational continuity in the design of remote care.",Master Health Sciences (M-HS),"van den Brink, F.",August 2025,English,"No

It examined which workstation features best support operators' physical and cognitive needs, and evaluated complementary tools and technologies for ergonomic assessment. A function tree analysis identified the essential functions of an ergonomic workstation, and a morphological chart was used to map potential solutions and assessment methods.A case study was conducted in which 19 participants assembled a fitness stepper using three workstation setups: basic, ergonomic, and custom. Physical ergonomics were assessed using IMU sensors, a markerless motion capture system, and smart insoles, while cognitive ergonomics were evaluated using the Raw TLX and CLAM method. MoCap data was analyzed in DHM software using the EAWS assessment method.Results showed that adjustable work height, flexible grab container positioning, and adaptable instruction formats reduced physical strain and perceived cognitive workload, particularly when tailored to individual anthropometric characteristics and preferences. Cobot assistance showed promise, but required better integration into the assembly process. IMU sensors were most effective for short-term posture assessment, while markerless camera systems showed potential for continuous monitoring if performance can be improved and limitations such as occlusion can be addressed. Smart insoles offered insight into material handling detection, and the CLAM method with Raw TLX captured perceived cognitive workload.The findings provide actionable guidelines for industry, emphasizing adjustable workstation features, operator-driven customization, and adaptable instruction formats. By integrating both physical and cognitive ergonomics within a single framework, this research offers practical recommendations and methodological foundation for designing future ergonomic manual assembly workstations that not only prevent musculoskeletal disorders but actively enhance operator wellbeing.

One of the methods for developing business case is e3value which introduces the concept of a value network, a network of economic actors exchanging value in the market. Constructing such network requires extensive knowledge and data acquisition. While search engine can lead to reliable data, the navigation task is labour intensive. Conversely, generative AI delivers answers in seconds, but suffers from unreliable results. To address this trade-off, this study presents Question-Answering System for Business Case, a question-answering (QA) system based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method and prioritises four key requirements: quick, reliable, up-to-date, and capable of providing options of answer. We propose proxy measures for assessing reliability: using PDF documents, enabling traceability, and integrating multiple independent data sources. We integrate a self-constructed Context-Aware PDF Database with scientific literature databases as the basis of our PDF corpora, which is further combined with web retrieval, forming the core knowledge bases. This system offers flexibility by allowing users to create and update the Context-Aware PDF Database based on their own input contexts and reference documents. The reference-free evaluation suggests that this system delivers contextually relevant answer with citations and additional sources in approximately 20 seconds. It also handles question variation and prevents hallucinations effectively. This study contributes to enhance user trust in downstream applications, particularly for creating a value network in business case development, and offers a baseline for future QA system that prioritises the proposed requirements. To further assess factual correctness and improve system robustness, future work should include reference-based evaluation with expert judgement, improve chunking strategies to reduce noise, and safeguards against large language model (LLM) summarisation errors.

A two-stage metaheuristic solution framework is proposed, where in the first stage, efficient batches are created by grouping customer orders. The second stage calculate near-optimal routes for each batch, specifically designed to handle the warehouse’s mixed-layout of standard and ultra-narrow aisles. The performance of the developed algorithm is extensively tested and benchmarked against a mathematical (MILP) model and the company’s current manual process.

However, foreign policy responses varied considerably in their commitment, particularly noticeable in the divergence between Poland and Hungary, which, despite their close alliance, embody the opposite ends within Europe. Understanding their divergent responses requires more than an analysis of systemic factors. Instead, this study adopts a neoclassical realist framework that allows to examine domestic unit-level factors that shape foreign policy, specifically leader images and strategic culture. Methodologically, this study conducts a content-analysis of public statements by Foreign Policy Executives (FPEs) and national security strategy documents. Using a process-tracing approach, the analysis compares pre-invasion leader images, expressed through ideological positions and national role conceptions, and key elements of strategic culture, including historical memory, alliance orientation and energy securitization, to explain the found divergent threat perceptions post-invasion. The results indicate that while ideological positions offer limited explanatory power, differences in national role conceptions and strategic culture account for the divergence in FPE threat perceptions and the subsequent foreign policy behaviour. By offering a deeper understanding of these domestic-level factors, the study provides insights that may help policymakers navigate divisions and enhance coordination at the European Union level.

Building on previous iterations, the project focuses on enhancing the lighting environ- ment to improve relighting accuracy and reduce light bias artifacts. A Dome-based RTI setup was refined through the implementation of RGBW LEDs, black light-absorbing paint, and a lens tube to limit external bias illumination. These physical modifications, paired with a newly introduced light level metric, were shown to improve the quality and consistency of RTI scans. Although the best-suited RTI model could not be fully evaluated on the embedded hardware due to the late delivery of the NVMe module, qualitative analysis and a literature review suggest that PTM and HSH are the most viable models for onboard use on the Raspberry Pi. The scan validation process incorporated both visual error maps and quantitative metrics, notably RMSE and SSIM, the latter proving more reliable in assessing perceptual accuracy. Overall, the system has been scientifically validated and optimized for digital surface relight- ing at the microscale.

108359,Assessing the feasibility of the SafeSense monitoring system to detect early signs of delirium,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108359,"IntroductionDelirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by sudden changes in attention, awareness, and cognition in hospitalized patients. Early detection is essential for timely intervention. Current screening depends on subjective clinical observations which can be inconsistent or delayed. The SafeSense® system uses pressure sensor mats in hospital beds to continuously and non-invasively track patient movement. Changes in activity, such as restlessness, nighttime movement, or reduced mobility, can occur in some forms of delirium and may help to recognise delirium earlier. This proof-ofconcept study explores whether SafeSense® data can support early delirium detection by visually analysing activity patterns. It also identifies whether visualizations of in-bed activity and out-of-bed time are suitable for distinguishing between delirium and non-delirium patient groups. MethodThis study analysed movement data collected via the SafeSense® system in a hospital setting. Data were gathered over five days from patients in the geriatrics, neurology, and medium care departments at Rijnstate hospital. Since direct access to raw sensor data was unavailable, activity information was extracted from SafeSense® output screenshots and converted into numerical data using automated scripts. Documented clinical observations from clinical records were used to classify patients into delirium and non-delirium groups. These delirium classifications were combined with the activity data to create a single data set for visualization. Visual analyses were performed to explore activity differences between delirium and non-delirium patients in terms of in-bed activity and out-of-bed time. ResultsA total of 9 patients was included in the study, with 5 classified as delirium patients and 4 as non-delirium patients. High variability in in-bed activity patterns was observed in both groups, with considerable overlap. However, more clear differences were observed in out-of-bed time. Patients with delirium more often left the bed during nighttime and showed a flattened day-night rhythm, whereas non-delirium patients tended to leave the bed mainly during daytime hours, reflecting a more typical day-night activity cycle. DiscussionThis proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of using SafeSense® sensor data for monitoring patient activity for early delirium detection. A reproducible method was developed to extract and visualize in-bed and out-of-bed time patterns. While in-bed activity alone was insufficient to distinguish delirium from non-delirium patients, out-of-bed time, particularly at night, revealed differences between the delirium and nondelirium groups. These findings suggest that the timing of activity may be more informative than activity levels for delirium monitoring. Despite limitations such as small sample sizeand indirect data access, this study provides a foundation for future research to develop predictive models and integrate continuous sensor monitoring into clinical practice.

Today’s technology of AI is presented as a technology that can replace many cognitive workers in one field, thus lowering the cost of labor and maximizing the output of services. Corporations worldwide want to make use of this by automating cognitive labor and replacing human workers with AI. This initiative is supported by claims that AI is more intelligent than humans and that, because it works autonomously, it is a more profitable and faster solution for cognitive labor. While it is possible to automate cognitive tasks that require algorithmic and rule-based processes, socially relevant cognitive labor requires more than that. Cognitive labor encompasses both elements of intellectual skills, such as intelligence, judgment, and reasoning, but also social skills, such as communication and sensibility. Even though AI does perform well in certain cognitive tasks like pattern recognition and classification, it still lacks social elements and qualities that make cognitive labor socially relevant. Therefore, the narrative of replacing human cognitive workers with AI rests not on facts or evidence about AI’s successful performance of cognitive tasks, but on arbitrary narratives about the intelligence and the autonomy of AI. The problem is that these claims of AI as superintelligent and autonomous are positioned as inevitable and normalized, making it difficult for cognitive workers to push against them. The goal of this thesis is to help solve that issue by answering the question of:How can we critically think about the narrative of replacing cognitive labor with AI?","Master Philosophy of Science, Technology and Society (M-PSTS)","Zulić, A.",August 2025,English,"No

According to the minority stress theory (MSM) resilience factors are able to moderate the relationship between these minority stressors, consisting of distal and proximal stressors, and mental health (Frost & Meyer, 2023). This study aimed to investigate (1) whether non-affirmation as a distal stressor and internalised homophobia as a proximal stressor are associated with depression in SGM individuals; and (2) whether self-esteem moderates the relationship between non-affirmation and internalised homophobia. An online survey using self-report measurements was conducted among a convenience sample of 53 SGM adults. Non-affirmation was significantly associated with internalised homophobia, but no direct associations were found between either non-affirmation or internalised homophobia and depression. Additionally, self-esteem did not moderate the relationship between non-affirmation and internalised homophobia. However, a strong negative correlation was found between self-esteem and depression. These results suggest that while minority stressors may not directly predict depressive symptoms in small or low-distress samples, self-esteem remains an important resilience factor. Given the limited sample size and potential selection biases, further rigorous research with larger, more diverse samples is recommended.

108354,The Impact of Organizational Culture on Individual Performance in Multiple Team Membership,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108354,"The present thesis explores the manner in which the extent of Multiple Team Membership (MTM) influences individual work performance, as well as the potential moderating effect of organizational culture on this relationship. MTM is conceptualized as a source of cognitive and temporal strain that undermines the ability to maintain performance across multiple roles, building on Conservation of Resources (COR) theory. The Three-Domain Model of Job Performance is employed to structure the outcome variable, with a distinction made between task performance, contextual performance, and counterproductive work behavior (CWB). The present study employs the Competing Values Framework (CVF) to examine organizational culture, distinguishing between Clan, Adhocracy, Hierarchy, and Market orientations. The data were collected via a cross-sectional survey administered to employees in Dutch knowledge-intensive organizations. The findings demonstrate that higher levels of MTM are negatively associated with task performance, consistent with the argument that resource depletion erodes performance. The study found no significant effects for contextual performance or CWB, suggesting that these domains are more strongly shaped by personal dispositions and social norms. With regard to cultural influences, the orientations of Clan, Adhocracy, and Hierarchy did not moderate the relationship between MTM and performance. Market culture exhibited a marked tendency to exacerbate the negative correlation with task performance, but not with contextual performance or CWB. These findings suggests that the direct strains of MTM are so immediate and powerful that distal cultural values have marginal effect with the exception of Market culture. This thesis makes a theoretical contribution by integrating COR theory, the Three-Domain Model, and the CVF to refine understanding of how MTM undermines performance and to nuance expectations about cultural influences. The practical implications of these findings underscore the necessity not to rely solely on cultural orientations, but rather on structural solutions, when addressing MTM strain.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Heijt, M.",August 2025,English,"No.

Participants completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, questions about sport participation and the Watts Connectedness scale. Descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVAs and causal mediation analyses were conducted. The results showed no significant differences in self-esteem and connectedness between the amount of sport participation and sport type. The data trends did not align with theoretical expectations. Solo sport participants reported a slightly higher connectedness to self, while team sports showed a slightly higher connectedness to others. These patterns were not significant.

Mobile mental health interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising solution by delivering personalized, context-sensitive support using real-time data. This scoping review systematically examines empirical studies of JITAIs targeting mental health outcomes and assesses their alignment with the six key design components proposed by Nahum-Shani et al. (2017). Additionally, it analyzes publication trends over time and geography for JITAIs in the mental health domain. Through a systematic search 11 eligible studies were identified, revealing considerable heterogeneity in design, populations, and outcomes. Most interventions relied on active Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) for tailoring, and several demonstrated improvements in proximal outcomes (e.g., mood, rumination reduction, increased daily meaningful activity) and distal outcomes such as reduced depression and anxiety symptoms. However, many studies were pilot or early-phase trials with small samples and incomplete reporting, limiting the ability to draw firm conclusions about long-term effectiveness. The bibliometric analysis indicated a recent increase in research activity, primarily centered in North America and Western Europe. Identified gaps include the limited use of micro-randomized trial designs and a lack of substantial longitudinal assessments. The integration of passive sensing, machine learning, and large language lodels within JITAIs represents an underexplored yet promising avenue to enhance real-time personalization. Although resource-intensive, these directions offer opportunities to advance the effectiveness and receptivity of JITAIs for mental health care.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Kindhäuser, L.",August 2025,English,"No

Parental involvement is crucial in children’s informal STEM learning, as they provide guidance and scaffolding for children’s growth in daily life beyond formal classrooms. This study investigates parental involvement in informal STEM learning for primary school students in Shanghai, a context where formal education is highly prioritized. Using the expectancy-value theory (EVT) as a framework, this study explores how parents' self-efficacy, value of informal STEM and perceived costs regarding informal STEM learning influence parental involvement. An online questionnaire was completed by 62 parents of primary school students in Shanghai. Quantitative results from three separate linear regressions showed that parents’ self-efficacy was a strong, statistically significant positive factor of parental involvement in informal STEM learning, while parents’ value of informal STEM had no statistically significant effect. Unexpectedly, parents’ perceived costs showed a small, statistically significant positive relationship with parental involvement. Qualitative analysis revealed that Shanghai parents need a range of support, from foundational skill-building training regarding STEM for those parents who felt less satisfied with their involvement to school-based support for those parents who were already highly involved. According to the needs from Shanghai parents, this study also offers specific advice for different stakeholders to develop targeted support that could empower Shanghai parents as facilitators of children’s informal STEM learning.

108347,Towards Predicting the Outcome of Achilles Tendon Lengthening in Diabetic Feet: A Reliable Assessment of Ankle Dorsiflexion & The Impact of Limited Dorsiflexion on Plantar Pressure Distribution,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108347,"One of the many causes of diabetic foot ulcers, in particular of pressure-related plantar forefoot ulcers, is a short Achilles tendon. Limited ankle dorsiflexion is one of the manifestations of a short Achilles tendon, which can be addressed with an Achilles tendon lengthening procedure. This procedure aims to redistribute the plantar pressure over the plantar surface to obtain a normal distribution. However, it is yet unknown how much lengthening is necessary. In current practice, maximal dorsiflexion serves as a substitute for the magnitude of length increase. During the procedure, the surgeon incrementally increases dorsiflexion until deemed satisfactory. This subjective assessment is prone to errors, as insufficient and excessive lengthening remain possible. Therefore, this research examines whether the required amount of dorsiflexion can be accurately predicted based on the plantar pressure profile, as peak pressure is a key factor in the development of foot ulcers. This research is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on a reliable assessment of ankle dorsiflexion. The second part focuses on the impact of limited dorsiflexion on the plantar pressure distribution. In the first part of the research, a new ankle dorsiflexion measurement technique was developed, and its reliability was evaluated. Current clinical and scientific measurement techniques demonstrated considerable variability, and existing devices were unavailable and required personalized setup, increasing the complexity of the device and measurement time. Consequently, a new, easy-to-use ankle dorsiflexion measurement device with a standardized measurement protocol was developed by the research team. The device consisted of a plantar platform and a tibial support to align the plantar surface to the tibia. Heel, lateral, and medial foot supports were integrated to prevent movement of the foot within the device. A fixed moment was applied to the platform to pull the ankle into maximal dorsiflexion. Five participants were included, who each measured the remaining participants twice. Thus, each participant served as tester and subject. Intra-tester reliability was determined for the repeated measurements of one tester on the same subject, and inter-tester reliability was determined for each tester with another tester who measured the same subjects (four assessments per tester). Although the ICC point estimates of most intra- and inter-tester reliability suggest good to excellent reliability, the large 95% confidence intervals indicate a high level of uncertainty. Intra-tester ICCs ranged from 0.45 (0.00; 0.95) to 0.96 (0.31; 1.00), and inter-tester ICCs ranged from 0.00 (0.00; 0.96) to 0.97 (0.06; 1.00). Furthermore, the SEM was clinically acceptable (≤ 5°), suggesting a good precision of the device. However, the MDC of both the intra- and inter- rater reliability is quite large (≥ 5°), suggesting the device cannot accurately measure the change in dorsiflexion on an individual level. Moreover, heel lifting was observed during some measurements, which is most likely the primary cause of the disagreement between measurements. Therefore, the Flex40 Meter has not been proven reliable yet. Recommendations for design adjustments and future research were provided. In the second part of the research, patterns in plantar pressure distributions were explored as potential predictors for developing a new prediction model that estimates the required dorsiflexion during Achilles tendon lengthening. Currently, the amount of dorsiflexion needed is subjectively determined by the surgeon. A more objective approach might improve the surgical outcomes. However, the exact relationship between maximum ankle dorsiflexion and plantar pressure distribution has not been investigated yet, even though the aim of increasing the dorsiflexion is to obtain a normal plantar pressure distribution. Therefore, this research aimed to identify patterns in the plantar pressure distribution that are associated with maximum ankle dorsiflexion. This was a pilot study with data from one clinical participant and four healthy participants. The maximum ankle dorsiflexion and plantar pressure distribution were collected from each participant. Maximum Pressure Pictures and six pressure parameters were extracted from the pressure data. Descriptive analysis was performed on both the Maximum Pressure Pictures and the parameters, whereas regression analysis was performed on the parameters only. No consistent patterns were identified in the plantar pressure distribution regarding the dorsiflexion angle. Descriptive analysis presumed that peak pressure beneath the first metatarsal, increased midfoot loading, and increased pressure-time integral were associated with a short Achilles tendon. However, these results are highly subject- specific, as only one clinical participant was included, and must be interpreted in the context of the participant. Moreover, plantar pressure distribution exhibited substantial inter-individual variability, which limits the ability to make meaningful comparisons between participants and groups. Regression analysis assumed a significant relation (p≤0.05) between the contact time and maximum dorsiflexion and pressure-time integral and maximum dorsiflexion. R2 was larger than 0.8 for both parameters as well, indicating that the variation in the dependent variable was explained by the independent variable. However, no conclusions can be drawn from these results, as only five participants were involved, which is too few for a regression analysis. Moreover, the difference in contact time and pressure-time integral between the clinical participant and healthy participants was substantial. Consequently, the healthy participants formed a distinct cluster, with regression analysis drawing a line from the clinical participant to this cluster. Further research with more participants is necessary to confirm the findings and to draw definitive conclusions. Recommendations for future research were provided.",Master Technical Medicine (M-TM),"Pinkster, A.E.",August 2025,English,"No

108346,3D assessment and surgical planning of hallux valgus,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108346,"Hallux valgus is one of the most common foot deformity in adults. Correction of the deformity is associated with various complications, with recurrence being the most common. The major cause behind recurrence is attributed to surgical factors. The selection of surgical procedure is done using 2D radiograph. However, the hallux valgus deformity is a multiplanar problem. This study therefore aimed to transition the assessment and surgical planning from 2D to 3D by creating a 3D measurement method and a surgical planning protocol. In the first part, a measurement method was created to assess the hallux valgus deformity in 3D using six variables. The method was assessed based on clinically relevancy, repeatability and robustness. In the second part, the measurement method was used to quantify the normal values of the six variables. This was done by measuring the angles in 17 healthy feet and determining the mean, standard deviation and 95% confidence intervals. In the third part, a protocol was developed for the 3D surgical planning of the Lapidus procedure. To determine the clinical relevancy, the protocol was tested on six patients and the resulting plans were discussed together with an orthopedic foot and ankle surgeon. To determine the reproducibility, the protocol was performed twice by two observers and a dice coefficient was calculated. This study can be used to further improve the surgical correction of hallux valgus by transitioning towards 3D analysis and surgical planning. This thesis showed the possibilities of measuring the deformity in 3D and using this to create a 3D surgical planning of the Lapidus osteotomy.

Data Apps and dataspace services are designed to demonstrate practical value creation from the shared data to stakeholders. However, findings of expert interviews show that technical infrastructure alone is insufficient to enable synchromodal transport. While the architecture supports vertical collaboration between participants, horizontal collaboration, between direct competitors, remains limited without shared governance models, trust frameworks and clear data usage policies.

In this context, internet access is framed as a universal necessity and an instrument of progress and nation-building, promoted through “internetification” programs. Amidst this push, the Indigenous Baduy Dalam community recently requested that their territory be designated as an internet “blank spot.” This request was accommodated by the government, challenging the assumption that connectivity is universally beneficial and offering an important empirical case for analyzing the relations between the government and Indigenous communities in Indonesia. Guided by the main research question: “How is the Baduy community’s refusal of internet connectivity understood, negotiated, and accommodated within Indonesia’s digital governance framework?”,I employed the Sociology of Knowledge Approach to Discourse (Keller, 2011; 2013) to identify multiple meanings of the internet across actor groups, drawing on semi-structured interviews and field observations. The analysis shows that while some meanings remained internal to specific groups, others circulated through processes of translation, giving rise to three discourse coalitions: a nation-building coalition framing the internet as a driver of integration and development; an adat-sovereignty coalition viewing it as a violation of sacred order and a source of external threat; and an intermediary coalition, composed of journalists, local experts, local officials, and activists, bridging the two through translation. The intermediary coalition enabled the blank spot accommodation by translating the Baduy’s cosmologically grounded refusal into a rationale of moral protection and visibility risk, more closely aligned with the national government’s narratives. This translation allowed the refusal to be accepted as a culturally sensitive adaptation within the digital nation-building agenda, but in doing so, it stripped the refusal of its ontological depth. The result is a fragile discursive compromise, the success of which depends on how it is interpreted by different actors. This outcome reflects broader relational dynamics between Indigenous communities and the Indonesian government, which rest on a fragile equilibrium of partial inclusion contingent on alignment with dominant imaginaries and conditional recognition. From these findings, there is a need for digital governance frameworks that recognize refusal as a legitimate stance, rather than subsuming Indigenous worlds into a singular vision of progress. I therefore call for the acknowledgement of ontological non-use in policy, which refers to refusal rooted in fundamentally different worldviews about technology’s place in life. This concept opens possibilities for sovereignty grounded in ontological differences and redefines user-technology relations, which, in turn, can contribute to a more contextualized digital transformation agenda based on a pluriversal approach.

To address this challenge, Isala established a Virtual Care Centre (VCC), where nurses provide remote monitoring and guidance to patients. As the demand and case mix complexity increase, long-term workforce planning becomes essential. This thesis investigates how a stochastic decision-support model can support nurse staffing decisions at a VCC under uncertain care demand. We develop a data-driven decision-support tool that integrates Monte Carlo simulation with a two-stage stochastic Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model. The tool translates uncertain demand into implementable weekly nurse schedules, using historical data and nurse input to capture patient arrivals, task durations, alerts, and emergency calls. In the first stage, weekly full-day nurse shifts are planned; in the second stage, workload allocation and overtime are determined per scenario. The model is solved with Sample Average Approximation. The approach allows decision makers to evaluate workforce schedules under uncertainty, future demand scenarios, and assess trade-offs between staffing levels, overtime, and workload overflow. Although tailored to the VCC at Isala, the framework is designed to be adaptable to other virtual care environments facing similar workforce planning challenges.",Master Industrial Engineering and Management (M-IEM),"Telman, R.",August 2025,English,"No.

Considering rice cultivation accounts for the largest share of agricultural land use in Taiwan, this study aims to study the potential benefits of the ""Small Farmers' Carbon Farming Project in Taiwan"" project (SFCFP), which is the first CCFP in Taiwan registered with an international voluntary carbon credit standard (VCCS), launched in 2022, and focused on smallholder rice farmers. Based on a desk study and interviews with stakeholders involved in the SFCFP, this study concludes that farmers' primary motivations for participation include their perception of the urgency of industry transition, no-cost participation, and collective decisions of the farmers’ groups.As the SFCFP has not completed the certification, there are still no tangible financial benefits. Besides, several concerns arise from the differing interests among the stakeholders of the SFCFP, particularly regarding the quality of monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV), as well as the government agency’s inability to directly oversee the project. However, these issues may be addressed by improving the project’s transparency and facilitating closer collaboration between parties. Additionally, current regulations do not recognize carbon credits issued by international VCCSs for domestic use, which hinders Taiwan-based corporations from collaborating with the SFCFP. In the future, if the regulations are adjusted, CCFPs could generate greater benefits by targeted partnerships with companies from different sectors.

However, collecting and annotating images is an expensive and labor-intensive process. Especially in maritime object detection, where objects are scarce, obtaining labeled real-world data with varied conditions is not often feasible. Maritime Simulation engines offer an alternative by generating realistic synthetic images with different object categories required for maritime object detection. They could also simulate hazardous scenarios which are impractical in real-world situations due to the risk of damage to life and property. The major challenge is that the object detection models trained with the simulation images suffer a significant performance degradation when tested on real images, due to the presence of inherent domain differences between simulation and real images. This thesis addresses these problems by introducing (1) A synthetic maritime dataset for object detection, (2) A Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) framework to address the domain gap in object detection, enabling models trained on synthetic simulation images to generalize effectively on real-world marine images, with a performance increase of up to 6.15%.

As an engineer-to-order (ETO) organization, VMI faces unique challenges regarding their spare part management: the range of possible spare parts is vast, demand is unpredictable, and forecasting is particularly difficult. Correctly choosing which items to stock, and in what quantities, is therefore a significant challenge. With a growing emphasis on the importance of adequate strategic goals for the after-sales service department, VMI requires an objective method to evaluate how delivery performance objectives (target fill rates, delivery times) impact inventory risks (holding costs). This study focuses on the development of a model that is capable of identifying this tradeoff, and advice on inventory control policies given a desired performance.

108336,Patient Voices on Off-label Interventions for Long Covid: a qualitative study,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108336,"Background:Long Covid is a complex, chronic disease with significant impact on the health and daily functioning of patients. Due to the lack of proven treatments, patients and doctors try interventions with hypothetical efficacy, such as nicotine patches, low-dose naltrexone, metformin and H1 blockers. This thesis explores Long Covid patients’ experiences with these four interventions, focusing on patients’ motivation to start, use and perceived (side) effects. The objective is to contribute to the development of the websitelongcovidtoolkit.org, which aims to combine scientific research and patient experiences to reduce the lack of information and support informed treatment choices for Long Covid. Methods:A qualitative descriptive study was conducted using semi-structured online interviews. Participants were Long Covid patients with experience with at least two of the interventions. The interviews were conducted using an interview guide, which was drawn up from literature and input from stakeholders. The interviews were then transcribed and coded inductively by using an experimental AI-software, and later Microsoft Excel. Results:Nicotine patches were mainly used to reduce PEM complaints, with the price, safety and accessibility of the intervention not posing any barriers for the patients. Participants used cuttable patches, with varying doses from 5.5 to 7 milligrams. Reported benefits were reduced PEM and brain fog complaints, while different side effects, like skin irritation were mentioned. Low dose naltrexone was used for a variety of complaints, such asfatigue and cognitive complaints. The price and safety of the intervention posed no barriers for the use, however, the accessibility of it was a little bit more complicated, because it is only accessible with a doctor’s prescription. Participants used a titration scheme to build up their dosage, with those end dosages ranging from 2.5 to 4.5 milligrams. Participants took the intervention by diluting drops of LDN in water and drinking it. The benefits that participants reported included reduced fatigue complaints, like PEM, and reduced cognitive complaints, like reading. The side effects, such as nausea and losing weight, were reported to be worse when the dosage was raised. Metformin was used to reduce tremors, intestinal flora and to help preventthe development of Long Covid Only the price of the intervention played a role in the decision to start using the intervention, but it did not pose a barrier, because metformin is reimbursed. Participants used the intervention in tablet form, either taking one of two tablets of 500 milligrams. The use of metformin did not lead to participants experiencing any positive effects, however, they did report experiencing side effects, like diarrhea or dizziness. H1 blockers were used to reduce different complaints, such as allergic complaints, POTS and brain fog. The price, as well as the safety and accessibility, were reported as more a motivation than a barrier for participants. The use of H1 blockers was not unambiguous among participants, as different types of the intervention were used, all of which were in tablet form. It was also reported that H1 blockers were frequently used in combination with H2 blockers. A wide variety of benefits was reported, such as reduced sleeping problems and reduced allergic reactions, while on the other hand almost no side effects were reported. Discussion and conclusion:Although this was a preliminary exploratory study, the results suggest that participants generally perceive nicotine patches, low-dose naltrexone and H1 blockers as effective treatments for Long Covid. Metformin, on the other hand, was perceived as less effective, as it had more side effects than positive effects. These findings offer an overview on how patients experience these interventions, and thus contribute to the development of the website.",Bachelor Health Sciences (B-GZW),"Prijs, S.",August 2025,English,"No.

While GenAI offers tailored language and academic support, its effectiveness depends largely on users’ ability to craft effective prompts. Using survey data from 104 Asian students studying at Western universities, this research employed mediation analysis to test four hypotheses. Results show no significant direct relationship between GenAI use and either perceived language barriers or information-seeking behaviors. However, prompt engineering skills fully mediate the association between GenAI use and perceived language barriers and the association between GenAI use and information-seeking behaviors. These findings highlight that frequent GenAI use alone does not guarantee academic benefits; rather, the educational value of GenAI is realized through skillful and strategic prompting. Practical implications suggest that universities should move beyond general AI literacy workshops and provide structured training in prompt engineering to better equip students for academic success.",Master Educational Science and Technology (M-EST),"Zhong, R.",August 2025,English,"No

Humanity faces significant environmental challenges that demand immediate action. Future Consciousness is the ability to engage with and plan for the future, and cultivating it provides a basis for guiding humanity toward a more sustainable future and ensuring long-term well-being across generations. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the psychological processes underlying future-oriented behaviour, this study also examines Cognitive Dissonance and Self-Determination, key factors influencing motivation. Aim. This study examines the relationship between Future Consciousness, Self-determination, and Cognitive Dissonance in students to better understand what motivates individuals to act today for a better future. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 102 students using the following instruments: the Future Consciousness Questionnaire, the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale, and the Dissonance Arousal and Reduction Questionnaire. Correlational and mediation analyses were used to examine the association among the variables. Results. Future Consciousness is positively associated with both Self-determination and Cognitive Dissonance, and Self-determination is also positively related to Cognitive Dissonance. However, there was no significant evidence to establish Self-determination as the mediating variable between Future Consciousness and Cognitive Dissonance. Discussion. These findings highlight that Future Consciousness and Self-determination play an essential role in fostering awareness of internal inconsistencies, which can motivate behavioural change, providing insights that support individual growth and inform more effective interventions to address pressing global challenges, such as climate change.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Comas Colomer, Q.",August 2025,English,"No

As part of the steps of the EIS method, the impedance data will integrate the health indicators of the NMC battery cell used for the initial impedance measurements and the different ways of testing the battery: WLTC, DST, and EHPPC testing techniques. EIS measurements were collected for different state of charge (SOC) of the battery (40%, 60% and 80%) for the initial test with no ageing effects (the first discharging cycle) and for all the testing performed to the NMC battery cell. The estimation of SOC of the battery was first performed without including the health indicator and by only considering the correlation and the points with the least SOH effects. Due to not accurate SOC estimation, the health indicator was integrated in the SOC estimation calculation, therefore the SOC approximation is much more accurate when the health indicator is considered in the estimation process due to the high SOH effect on the battery. The initial state of charge for 60% has the best estimation for EHPPC testing, which has the SOC estimation equal to 61.614% and for the 80% true initial SOC is 76.219% SOC estimation for DST testing.

One pathway to improve a person’s spiritual well-being is through a nature-based mindfulness intervention. Little is known about how a person’s connection to nature influences the effects of such an intervention. That is why the current study investigates whether nature-connectedness moderates the impact of a nature-based mindfulness intervention on spiritual well-being. A total of 41 participants took part in the two-week-long study, who were observed at three different time points. A linear mixed-effects model was then used to test the interaction effect of nature-connectedness, with complete case analysis and multiple imputation employed to act as additional sensitivity analyses. The results indicate that nature-connectedness is not a statistically significant moderator in this context, but the observed outcomes give rise to the idea that individuals with lower levels of nature-connectedness could experience increased benefits from a nature-based mindfulness intervention.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Barth, D.D.",August 2025,English,"No.

Freezing of Gait (FOG) is a symptom of PD. It is described as a sudden inability to move the legs while walking. Reliable methods for detecting FOG in naturalistic home settings are urgently needed to improve patient care. Anxiety, a common non-motor symptom in PD, has been shown to be closely linked to the onset and severity of FOG. Skin conductance (SC), also called Electrodermal activity (EDA), a marker of sympathetic nervous system activity, offers a potential non-invasive measure to capture anxiety-related changes preceding FOG. This study investigated short-term fluctuations in SC around FOG onset, using data from 10 PD participants performing daily-life activities in a semi-controlled, home-like environment. EDA was recorded with an Empatica E4 wristband (4 Hz) and preprocessed with cvxEDA decomposition to isolate the phasic component. Three features—mean, standard deviation, and area under the curve—were extracted for three consecutive 3-second windows: Baseline, Pre-FOG, and FOG. Group-level analysis of 252 FOG events revealed a consistent and statistically significant decrease in all phasic SC features from Baseline and Pre-FOG to the FOG, while individual-level results were significant in only two participants. Visual inspection confirmed this downward trend in over 63% of events.These findings suggest that FOG onset is often preceded by a reduction in phasic SC, potentially reflecting sympathetic down-modulation. This autonomic signature may represent a physiological “freezing” parallel to motor arrest. While further validation and richer feature sets are needed, SC could serve as a complementary biomarker in multimodal FOG detection and prediction systems.

Temperaturechanges were measured using real-time thermometry during ablation, and T1 maps were generatedpost-ablation to validate the thermometry results. An optical fiber was used as a temperature referenceunder static conditions. Real-time thermometry successfully detected temperature changes duringablation. However, post-ablation T1 maps and calculated temperature maps showed no significant differences.RF ablation and real-time MR thermometry can be successfully performed at the Universityof Twente.

108321,De rol van doelstelling bij het gebruik van digitale mentale gezondheidsinterventies,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108321,"Achtergrond:Wereldwijd ondervinden steeds meer studenten mentale gezondheidsproblemen, en weinig van deze studenten ontvangen professionele hulp. Een mogelijke oplossing hiervoor is het gebruik van eHealth apps, deze eHealth apps worden ook wel DMHI’s (Digital Mental Health Interventions) genoemd. Om een DMHI effectief te laten zijn voor studenten zijn er verschillende aspecten van belang, waaronder het stellen van doelen. Er is nog weinig onderzoek gedaan naar het stellen van doelen, en daarom worden in dit onderzoek de ervaringen van studenten bij het stellen van doelen in beeld gebracht. Doel:Het doel van dit onderzoek is om de ervaringen bij het stellen van doelen, door studenten die een DMHI gebruiken, in beeld te brengen. Zowel de doelen die de voorkeur voor een DMHI bepalen als de doelen bij het gebruik van een DMHI. Methode:Er is gekozen voor een onderzoek met een kwalitatief design. De deelnemers hebben gedurende een periode van twee weken gebruik gemaakt van een DMHI. Per deelnemer zijn er twee interviews afgenomen. De interviews waren semigestructureerd opgezet, en er is gebruik gemaakt van interviewschema’s waarin vragen over het stellen van doelen, tevredenheid en betrokkenheid geformuleerd waren. Na afname zijn de interviews getranscribeerd en gecodeerd. Er is eerst een driedeling van groepen gedaan als deductieve codering, en na het opdelen in drie groepen is er een coderingsschema opgesteld door middel van inductief coderen. Resultaten:In dit onderzoek zijn er 34 deelnemers twee keer geïnterviewd. Deze deelnemers hebben bij het stellen van doelen verschillende ervaringen opgedaan. De doelen die de voorkeur voor een DMHI bepaalden waren wisselend, hier kwamen bijvoorbeeld dagelijkse structuur creëren, stress verminderen of reflecteren op het eigen leven naar voren. Over de doelen tijdens het gebruik van de DMHI ging het bij een gedeelte van de deelnemers over het gebruik per dag. En ook werden er door de deelnemers veel ervaringen gerapporteerd over de kleine en duidelijke taken en doelen gesteld door een DMHI. Discussie en conclusie:Concluderend hebben studenten het stellen van doelen verschillend ervaren. Bij het aangeven van een voorkeur voor DMHI speelt het persoonlijke doel, zoals stressvermindering of mentale welzijn verbeteren, een grote rol. En tijdens het gebruik van een DMHI wordt het zelf stellen van doelen als aspect gezien met het meeste effect op het gebruik van de DMHI en de motivatie. De ervaringen van de deelnemers laten zien dat het stellen van doelen als belangrijk onderdeel gezien kan worden bij het gebruik van een DMHI, maar dat niet alle studenten dit actief doen. Uit de resultaten van de interviews blijkt dat deelnemers wisselend bezig zijn met het stellen van doelen, en het gebruik van een DMHI dus ook verschillend wordt ervaren. Het stellen van doelen speelt dus een belangrijke rol in de ervaringen van studenten bij het gebruik van een DMHI. Maar er zijn veel variaties aanwezig bij het stellen van doelen door studenten, en relaties tussen factoren zullen in verdere onderzoeken aangetoond moeten worden.",Bachelor Health Sciences (B-GZW),"Peters, S.F.",August 2025,Dutch,"No

Case study: TenneT’s Bay Replacement Project (BRP),https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108318,"AbstractThis thesis applies the Visual, Environmental, Socioeconomic, and Procedural Aspects (VESPA) framework developed by Petrova (2015) to examine the social acceptance of infrastructureupgrades within TenneT’s Bay Replacement Program (BRP) in the Netherlands. The BRP involves the modernisation of over 140 high-voltage substations across the country, including projects located near Natura 2000 areas and densely populated residential zones. The VESPA framework was initially used to assess social acceptance of a wind turbines. However, this study represents its first application to BRPs. The research investigates how nature-inclusive and biodiversity-enhancing measures influence local acceptance of BRP. A qualitative, case-based methodology was used, including semi-structured interviews with project managers and stakeholders, document analysis, literature review and site observations. For the case selection, three substations Alphen aan den Rijn, Raalte, andTerwinselen were selected to assess variation in public perception across different spatial and procedural contexts. Findings indicate that visual integration and environmental aspect are key factors influencing acceptance. While ecological measures such as the use of modular construction, Water Drainage and Infiltration (WADIs), and replanting schemes were implemented, these were often secondary to more immediate concerns such as noise levels and the visual intrusion of electrical infrastructure. Terwinselen revealed that residents responded negatively to the removal of trees and the lack of acoustic mitigation. In contrast, Alphen aan den Rijn demonstrated how design coordination with municipalities, aesthetic improvements, and early public engagement can lead to high levels of acceptance. The study concludes that biodiversity-enhancing interventions alone are insufficient to ensure public support. Instead, they must be embedded within a wider approach that addresses environmental, visual, socioeconomic, and procedural dimensions. The VESPA framework has proven to be a valuable analytical tool for understanding the conditions under which large-scale grid infrastructure projects like BRP can be more socially legitimate.",Master Environmental and Energy Management (M-EEM),"Yacob, D.",August 2025,English,"No

Since desired behaviors are often easier to demonstrate than to pre-program, Learning from Demonstration (LfD) becomes particularly compelling. However, limitations in input data and lack of knowledge about task objectives often require human intervention, limiting autonomy and scalability. The emergence of Visual Language models (VLMs) offers a promising direction to address this gap, complementing low-level trajectory demonstrations with visual context and semantic understanding. This study investigates the potential of off-the-shelf VLMs as components for downstream evaluation and adaptation of robotic tasks. To address the performance uncertainty evident in such models, the study proposes Dynamic Sequential Prompting, encouraging structured task evaluation. This method extracts necessary information solely from the model's interpretation of the scene, minimizing external influence. Experimental results show that although the proposed framework outperforms manually designed, task-specific prompts in terms of accuracy and alignment with human evaluations, model limitations in temporal consistency and contextual awareness indicate the need for further refinement before being fully integrated into robotic pipelines.",Master Biomedical Engineering (M-BME),"Kyriakou, F.",August 2025,English,"No

Using a functional unit of 1 kg hydrogen per day over system lifetime, the study quantifies material flows, environmental impacts, and recyclability performance for both electrolyser types. Findings indicate that AEL systems outperform PEM in overall material circularity and recyclability, for their use of common metals like nickel and steel, which benefit from mature recycling infrastructure. In contrast, PEM systems are constrained by their reliance on platinum group metals (PGMs) and perfluorinated membranes with limited recovery options. MCI scores reflect these limitations, with PEM components such as iridium, platinum, and Nafion scoring low or negative. LCA results similarly show higher greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and water use for PEM systems, driven by the embodied impacts of critical materials. From an environmental management perspective, this study sheds light on how circularity metrics can support strategic technology planning, responsible material use, and alignment with EU circular economy policies. It highlights the importance of embedding circular economy principles into early-stage design and material selection for green hydrogen infrastructure. Recommendations for future work include incorporating techno-economic, such as valuating the economic feasibility, cost-benefit trade-offs, and scalability of material recovery solutions in electrolyser systems, and social assessments, particularly focusing on labour equity, access to material recovery infrastructure, and the distribution of benefits in global recycling chains, as well as exploring pathways to improve material recovery and system durability.",Master Environmental and Energy Management (M-EEM),"Kuba, J.",August 2025,English,"No

Findings show that, despite technical maturity and growing decentralized uses, niche development is constrained by weak institutional support, distorted prices from fossil-fuel subsidies, and policy implementation. Regime dynamics (rent-seeking and fragmented governance) deter investment, while landscape pressures (sanctions, climate pledges) create both constraints and openings (rural access, energy security). Recommendations include targeted subsidy reform, strengtheningRenewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization (SATBA)’s funding and execution capacity, piloting solar innovation zones, and mobilizing international climate finance.

This study is a replication study of the seminal textbook “Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction” by Sutton and Barto. We examine the replicability of their results and asses the compatibility of their Markov decision process (MDP) models with the Modest modelling language. We find the results of Sutton and Barto are generally replicable, though their work does not always explicitly specify all required parameters required for replication. We implement the algorithms Sutton and Barto define in the textbook within modes, a statistical model checker from the Modest Toolset—a collection of tools originally designed for the analysis and (formal) verification of stochastic models. The toolset comes from the world of formal verification of models, and is as of yet not perfectly suitable for implementing RL algorithms. modes and Modest make slightly different assumptions about Markov decision processes than Sutton and Barto do, and Modest has other shortcomings for easily modelling the models introduced by Sutton and Barto. We propose a structure to easily implement new RL algorithms within modes and give recommendations to make modes and the Modest language better suitable for (deep) RL.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Oliemans, R.P.",August 2025,English,"No

The printing table is capable of controlled movement along the X, Y, and Z axes such that a multilayered object can be printed. In this project, three main challenges regarding 3D-printing of rubbers are faced. First of all, it turned out to be a challenge to print a geometrical stable product. Furthermore, porosity inside the compounds was observed. The third challenge was to measure and control the adhesion between the rubber strands. To allow for the best printing product quality, both the compound formulation and the process parameters were optimized. Shown was that co-rotating screws lead to minimal porosity. The velocity control along the printing path is key to maintain geometry. Furthermore, a larger interfacial contact area lead to better adhesion between the layers.

As digital coaching technologies mature and the demand for personalised, engaging, and motivating sport-tracking tools increases, it becomes evident that the success of such systems depends not only on technical accuracy but also on their ability to build users' trust, empathy, and motivation. This growing expectation highlights the importance of studying how embodiment-through human-like visual and conversational interfaces-can improve the perceived quality of interaction and the effectiveness of coaching. The study focuses on the wearM.ai prototype, a system that combines biomechanical data collection, musculoskeletal simulation, and LLM-based natural language feedback. Following a human-centred design process, the project involves extensive user research, iterative development of an ECA-integrated coaching interface, and an exploratory comparative study focusing on the effect of embodiment. Although no statistically significant quantitative evidence was found regarding the impact of embodiment, qualitative results indicate a consistent preferences and trends for embodied coaching in relation to trust, motivation, and perceived empathy. More than the individual findings, the novelty of the thesis lies in the consistent integration of design choices informed by research through user research, prototype development, and experimental setting. Ultimately, this work contributes to the broader conversation on digital coaching, offering insights into the role of embodiment and outlining a replicable methodology for the design and evaluation of future artificial intelligence-based, user-centred training systems.",Master Interaction Technology (M-ITECH),"Debertolis, A.",August 2025,English,"No.

108300,Change point analysis using neural networks,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108300,"Detecting change points in data is usually done using assumptions on the underlying distribution and type of change point to give a classification on the existence of a change point within the data, usually given some constraints on the size of the type I error as is the case in hypothesis testing. When the underlying distribution or the type of change point does not meet these assumptions a significant error can occur. In Li et al. (2024) a method is developed and theoretically analysed that uses deep learning to perform automatic change point detection. Using known results about the error bound of the CUSUM test statistic, a misclassification error bound of the neural network is derived. In this work the results are proven again, giving some extra context and expanding the results to also include a neural network able to represent an approximation of the Mann-Whitney U test for detecting change points in time series. In the empirical analysis it is also studied if the threshold values for the CUSUM test and Mann-Whitney U test can be trained, using the same data used for the neural network training. All classifiers are tested on Normal distributed data, Cauchy distributed data and data following a first order autoregressive process. An upper bound on the misclassification error rate of the neural network representation of the approximation of the Mann-Whitney U test is given relative to the misclassification error rate of the Mann-Whitney U test, with an upper bound to its approximation error and complexity error. The Mann-Whitney U test is also empirically shown to be a robust classification method in the case when data is generated using a heavy-tailed distribution such as the Cauchy distribution.",Master Applied Mathematics (M-AM),"Gortemaker, J.H.J.",August 2025,English,"No

Despite their great capabilities, LLMs are often used as black boxes, leaving developers uncertain about the correctness and reliability of generated outputs. This work addresses this challenge by focusing on uncertainty estimation for LLM-generated code, aiming to enhance interpretability and support developers in the decision-making process. We use the Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct model to generate Python solutions for 30 problems from three different competitive programming platforms: Kattis, SPOJ, and CodeForces. We calculate line-level uncertainty scores by sampling multiple explanations and assessing their semantic similarity with Sentence-BERT, estimating the model’s confidence in individual code lines. Additionally, we integrate code quality metrics via a Random Forest classifier to improve the estimation of line confidence and identify the most important features for line quality. Our results show that uncertainty varies with task difficulty only for similarity-based metrics and that combining similarity-based scores with code quality features substantially improves model uncertainty estimation. In addition, our user study indicates that uncertainty indicators help developers focus on potentially problematic code, though careful calibration is needed to avoid introducing bias. This work demonstrates an approach to enhance LLM interpretability in code generation, offering a solution for more trustworthy and user-aware AI-assisted software development.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Racoviță, C.",August 2025,English,"No

Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel reduction method called the weighted moment matching (WMM) method, which combines frequency-domain POD with moment matching principles. The WMM method selects snapshot-points based on the magnitude of the system’s transfer function and assigns corresponding weights to emphasize important frequency ranges. Unlike existing techniques, the WMM method is input-independent, robust to the choice of snapshot-points, and reliably produces accurate reduced-order models. Numerical experiments on the CD player benchmark model, demonstrate that the WMM method performs comparably or better than classical approaches such as, balanced truncation, iterative rational Krylov algorithm and POD, particularly in the low-frequency regime. These results highlight the potential of WMM as an effective and computationally efficient MOR technique for SISO LTI systems.",Bachelor Applied Mathematics (B-AM),"Roeten, W.S.",November 2025,English,"No

108297,Adapting Skill Assessment Tools to Reduce Age-Related Discrimination for Silver Workers in PSM Industry 4.0,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108297,"The quick technological advancements of Industry 4.0 are reshaping the Purchasing and Supply Management sector. These innovations demand new digital competencies from the PSM professionals, which can cause a digital divide. Therefore this shift brings challenges for Silver Workers, workers who are aged 50 years and above. Silver Workers, although having years of experience, often face barriers with these digital competencies, which makes it harder for them to adapt. What makes these challenges worse, is the problem of persisting age-related discrimination. Current Skill Assessment Tools focus mostly on hard-, soft-, and cognitive skills, which are valuable, but they fail to capture the full range of competencies that Silver Workers possess.Theseskillassessment tools may, although probably unintended, reinforce age-related discrimination by emphasizing what the Silver Workers lack, instead of valuing what they can contribute due to their extensive experience. Without fair and inclusive skill assessment tools, discrimination is kept in existence, under the false hope of a neutral evaluation.To address this, this study explores how current skill assessment tools can be improved to both recognize the competencies of Silver Workers better, but also to counteract age-related discrimination in the PSM sector as it transitions into Industry 4.0.The findings of this study reveal both direct and indirect forms of age-related discrimination, ranging from directly being excluded from training based on age, to issues like standardized training paths and skill assessments that overlook individuals strengths, or assume retirement-related disengagement. In contrast, participants showed a strong willingness to keep developing themselves and emphasized on the importance of experience, mentorship, and trust as important aspects of their ongoing value to the organizations. The results also show that current skill assessment tools tend to focus on deficits rather than strengths, and that experience should be leveraged as a strategic asset.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Boers, B.",August 2025,English,"No.

Drawing on literature from philosophy of technology, public administration, and gender studies, it builds a robust theoretical background that demonstrates the influence spaces have on queer gender expression, as well as the lack of discussion surrounding non-binary individuals in relation to spatiality. This theoretical foundation additionally highlights the need for non-binary inclusion in policy and spaces, as well as examining academic recommendations on how to embrace non-binary gender identities in both material space and cyberspace. Through an analysis of empirical data gathered from semi-structured interviews with Dutch municipal inclusivity officers, several key challenges, stakeholder reactions, and existing efforts within Dutch local governance are examined. By integrating these insights with academic suggestions, context-based recommendations are provided for Dutch municipalities to further include non-binary people in both material space, through restrooms, and cyberspace, through forms. Concerning forms, municipalities should no longer mention gender unless it can be demonstrated to be necessary. Regarding bathrooms, local governments should consider transforming gendered restrooms into all-gender bathrooms to ensure public support.

However, we are able to minimize the memory cost by not exploring the entire state-space, but only running simulations on the model, and storing the results of the runs. This method requires us to find techniques to resolve non-determinism in the model, one such technique being Lightweight Scheduler Sampling. This technique makes use of an integer which represents a randomly sampled scheduler, that is used to seed the randomized decisions. These techniques have so faronly been effectively applied to simpler Hybrid and stochastic models, ones which do not include temporal non-deterministic choices.

108285,Transition to low-chemical or chemical-free cooling water technologies in open recirculating cooling towers,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108285,"Industrial cooling towers are significant for heat dissipation in industries. Open recirculating cooling towers are widely used in industries like power generation, manufacturing and chemical processing. To manage scaling, corrosion and biofouling that can occur in these towers, chemical treatment methods are applied. Growing concerns about these chemicals and their harmful effects on aquatic and human health come with regulatory attention. This puts pressure on industries to transition to low-chemical or chemical-free cooling water treatment technologies. This research explores the socio-technical transition by focusing on three areas: regulatory influences on technology adoption, performance evaluation of low chemical technologies via key performance indicators and occurring transition barriers, specifically in the Netherlands in the EU context. The multi-level perspective framework is applied in this study to analyze the interactions between the regulatory landscape, industrial regimes and technological niche innovations. Overall, a qualitative methodology was used which involves semi-structured interviews with regulators, technology providers, and industrial users along with policy document analysis and literature-based performance assessments. The findings indicate that the EU and Dutch regulations encourage the sustainable transition but practically pose challenges in the transition pathways. The influence of these guidelines among stakeholders is uneven and moderate due to outdated international regulatory references and impractical national guidelines. The technological performance evaluation showed that emerging low chemical technologies have potential in addressing key water challenges but lack adoption due to limited field validation and operational unreliability. The firm lock-ins in industrial regimes further create challenges towards the transition. The study concludes that successful transition requires regulatory modernization, improved stakeholder coordination, and robust performance validation of emerging technologies. Major recommendations include updating the guidelines, developing standardized testing protocols, and fostering collaborative pilot projects between regulators, industries, and technology developers can ease the process of transition.",Master Environmental and Energy Management (M-EEM),"Rizwan, N.",August 2025,English,"No

108280,Bridging Policy Gaps in Plastic Recycling Through a System Lens: Enhancing National and European Regulations to Support Plastic Recycling Capacity for Dutch Recyclers,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108280,"As times are changing, the world increasingly requires a circular economy that prioritizes the concept of reduce, reuse, and recycling as its core strategy for sustainable resource management. For this strategy to succeed, plastic recyclers play a critical role by transforming post-consumer and industrial waste into secondary raw materials, reducing reliance on virgin material. Despite their strategic importance, the sector faces regulatory, market, and technical barriers that threaten its viability and its capacity to meet European circularity targets. This study focuses on the Dutch plastic recycling system, which experienced a decline in capacity as roughly one-third of national recycling facilities has disappeared. It is based on semi-structured interviews with Dutch plastic recycling industry experts, supplemented by secondary data from industry reports and EU legislation. Thematic analysis, combined with systems mapping, was used to identify systemic bottlenecks, policy misalignments, and potential leverage points for improving the recycling system’s performance. The findings of this study reveal that misalignment between EU and national policies, such as the National Circular Plastics Norm (NCPN) and the failed Polymerenheffing, created a competitive disadvantage for Dutch producers. The current Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework lacks effective financial incentives that increases domestic recyclate uptake and respondents called for European harmonization regarding EPR schemes. Technical challenges faced by recyclers include severe contamination of their input streams, insufficient sorting, and packaging designs that are not compatible with mechanical recycling processes. Market constraints are driven by the price advantage of virgin plastics, volatile demand for the recycled output, and feedstock competition between mechanical and chemical recyclers. Respondents widely regard the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) as transformative, but warn that its 2030 implementation may be too late to prevent capacity loss, especially regarding the upcoming Waste Shipment Regulation’s 2026 export ban. The Dutch recycling sector could lose capacity as many facilities close due to current challenges. However, certain measures could help stabilize demand. Accelerating PPWR recyclate obligations, postponing the WSR export ban, mandating design-for-recycling standards, and strengthening EPR fee modulation could address key bottlenecks within the plastic recycling system.

108279,"Shaping Energy Citizenship: Sociotechnical Imaginaries, National Energy Mixes and Governance in Türkiye, France and the Netherlands",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108279,"Over the last two decades, the clean energy transition has become a top priority for many countries, with Europe taking a leading role (European Union, 2023). Nevertheless, political shifts, including the rise of right-wing parties, and broader geopolitical developments, have created pressures against introducing regulations to accelerate the process. Despite these challenges, key initiatives have been launched to promote renewable energy and actively engage citizens as contributors to the energy system. This approach, known as 'energy citizenship', frames renewable energy as a shared societal resource, encouraging individuals to take an active role in the energy transition (Petrovics et al., 2022). However, the emergence and interpretation of energy citizenship vary across national contexts, reflecting the complexity of energy transitions, which involve long-term shifts in technology, policy, markets, consumer behavior, infrastructure, culture, and knowledge mediated by diverse actors (Geels, 2011). Historical energy policies, resource dependencies, and institutional frameworks further shape how actors participate in and perceive the energy transition. Moreover, sociotechnical imaginaries, collective cultural narratives that guide societal responses to innovation, play a key role in influencing how energy citizenship is understood, practiced, and institutionalized within specific national contexts (Jasanoff & Kim, 2013). By examining these dynamics, this study aims to understand how sociotechnical imaginaries, national energy mixes, and polycentric governance collectively shape the roles assigned to citizens in the energy transition. Using an interpretive approach focused on how language constructs social and political realities, the research explores energy citizenship as a socially constructed concept shaped by discourse and governance. Through a comparative analysis of Türkiye, France, and the Netherlands, this research seeks to identify patterns, divergences, and governance mechanisms that influence energy citizenship, offering insights into the structural and cultural factors that enable or constrain citizen engagement in the clean energy transition.

108278,"The State of Municipal Procurement in the Netherlands: Insights into Maturity, Ambitions, and Influencing Factors",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108278,"The procurement processes of Dutch municipalities play a crucial role in achieving social goals,ensuring transparency, and complying with laws and regulations. In particular, the contract management and purchase-to-pay (P2P) components determine the efficiency and effectiveness of municipal procurement. In 2020, Snijders developed the CEP maturity model to support municipalities in assessing and improving their procurement maturity. Since then, however, various trends, such as digitization, sustainability, and changing organizational dynamics, have not been adequately incorporated into the model, making it less applicable and up-to-date. Moreover, recent knowledge about the maturity level of municipalities in 2025 is lacking. This study had a dual purpose. First, the existing CEP model was evaluated and improved based on feedback from ten domain experts collected through a survey and two focus group sessions. Among other things, the revision led to the addition of an initial level and more nuance between successive maturity levels. The revised model was then applied in a nationwide survey of 88 municipalities aimed at measuring current and desired maturity levels. The results show that the current average maturity level is low (M = 1.94 on a scale of 1 to 5), with many municipalities, especially in the operational area, being at the fundamental or organized level. At the same time, ambition is high. On average, municipalities aim to achieve a level of 3.63 within five years, particularly toward the standardized level. The second goal of the study was to identify internal factors that influence progress on the maturity scale. The availability of substantive knowledge proved to be the most important explanatory factor. Municipalities with sufficient knowledge scored significantly higher on procurement maturity. Notable was the opposite effect of the factor time, which showed a significant negative influence. Other factors examined, such as budget, organization size, and organizational culture, showed no significant correlation with maturity level. The improved CEP model provides municipalities with a practical and accessible tool to determine their current maturity level, define their desired situation, and formulate targeted improvement steps. It supports self-assessment as well as strategic steering and benchmarking against other municipalities. Based on the results, realistic but ambitious growth targets can be set. By periodically using the model as a measurement tool, municipalities can monitor their progress and implement structural improvement measures. This approach contributes to a stronger positioning of procurement within the organization and further professionalization. Based on the findings, municipalities are advised to invest primarily in knowledge development, such as through training, knowledge sharing, and the recruitment of substantive expertise, to work towards a higher level of procurement maturity.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Roza, K.G.",August 2025,English,"No.

Grounded in the Blue Justice framework, which integrates distributional, procedural, and recognitional justice, the study explores how SSF actors interpret access, representation, and legitimacy in the governance of marine space. Employing a qualitative approach, the research draws on five distinct stakeholder interviews and the thematic analysis of planning documents including the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF), Marine Area Consents (MACs), and Designated Maritime Area Plans (DMAPs). Findings reveal that while MSP policy acknowledges participation, SSF stakeholders perceive persistent inequities across spatial access, engagement mechanisms, and cultural recognition. Consultations are experienced as delayed and symbolic, zoning and licensing tools disadvantage traditional practices, and informal knowledge systems remain structurally excluded. The study concludes that Cork Harbour’s MSP reflects equity in principle, but not in practice. Justice is interpreted through lived experience not institutional metrics. To move beyond procedural formalism, the thesis recommends co-management platforms, equity monitoring tools, and inclusive design structures. In a future shaped by Blue Justice, SSF communities are not invited; they are integrated, empowered, and recognised as stewards of the sea.",Master Environmental and Energy Management (M-EEM),"Keane, L.",August 2025,English,"No.

108276,Forest Height Estimation Using Sentinel 1 Coherence Images,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108276,"Accurate estimation of forest height is important for understanding forest structure, estimating aboveground biomass, and contributing to climate change mitigation efforts through carbon stock assessments. Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is considered the most accurate tool for measuring Forest height because of its high vertical resolution and ability to capture structural details. However, due to its high cost and limited spatial coverage, it is not always practical for large-scale or frequent forest monitoring. To overcome these challenges, this study uses the potential of Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) data focusing on interferometric coherence and phase for estimating Forest height in Veluwe region in the Netherlands.In this research, the Random Forest regression model is used to estimate forest height using coherence features derived from four Sentinel-1 image pairs. The model was trained using high-resolution airborne LiDAR data as reference. Performance was evaluated for different polarization combinations, including VV, VH, and a combined VV+VH setup, and across three canopy height ranges: 5–15 m, 15–25 m, and 25–40 m. Overall, the combined VV+VH features gave better and more stable results than using single polarization alone. Incorporating all four coherence pairs also improved the model’s accuracy compared to single pairs.The best performance was found in the 5–15 m height class, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 5.5 metres. However, the model performed less accurately for taller canopies. This is likely due to lower coherence values in those areas, which are affected by temporal decorrelation. Since Sentinel-1 operates ona 12-day repeat-pass cycle, changes in vegetation structure between acquisitions e in complex, tall forests can reduce the reliability of coherence measurements, impacting model predictions.Overall, the predictions shows that Sentinel-1 coherence and phase data can be effectively used to estimate forest canopy height, particularly when combined with machine learning However, the model still faces challenges in accurately predicting forest height in areas with tall and dense vegetation. Therefore, futurework should focus on improving model performance for taller canopy structures, possibly by addressing decorrelation effects It is also important to include more spatially diverse training samples to improve the generalization of the model across different forest types.",Master Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (M-GEO-WO),"Arora, U.",August 2025,English,"No

Er is erg weinig onderzoek naar de interactie tussen innovatielabs en lokale overheden. Door onderzoek te doen naar innovatielabs in Gemeente Enschede wordt in deze masterscriptie bepaald hoe een gemeente het beste labs kan indelen, wat de mogelijke voordelen zijn van samenwerking en welke factoren doorslaggevend zijn in de keuze om wel of niet samen te gaan werken. Door gebruik te maken van sneeuwbalsampling zijn 12 willekeurige innovatielabs in de gemeente geselecteerd en geïnterviewd. Deze labs lopen ver uiteen qua vorm, functie en managementstructuur. Door een analyse van de interviews met de 12 innovatielabs gecombineerd met een documentstudie van officiële gemeentedocumenten wordt er antwoord gegeven op de hoofdvraag: “Welke factoren zijn indicatief voor de mate van samenwerking tussen Gemeente Enschede en lokale innovatielabs?”. Het doel van dit onderzoek is exploratief te analyseren welke factoren invloed hebben op de relatie tussen verschillende innovatielabs en de lokale overheid.

108274,Shaping Contactless Payment Technology: The Negotiated Implementation of Indonesia’s QRIS,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108274,"This thesis investigates the implementation of QRIS (Quick Response Indonesian Standard) as Indonesia’s national contactless payment system. The use of contactless payments have become a global trend aimed to reduce cash dependency, often associated with technological advancement and efficiency. Near Field Communication (NFC) technology has become the standard in many Western countries, providing a seamless way for economic exchange. Yet, Indonesia prioritized a Quick Response (QR) based system instead in order to support the country’s digital inclusion. Building from the observation of this technological divergence, this thesis critically examines the rationale behind QRIS’ implementation. By combining perspectives from technological determinism, the social shaping of technology (SST), and critical theory of technology (CCT), this thesis explores the emergence of contactless payment technologies and the ways in which QRIS was shaped to accommodate Indonesia’s socio-economic and technological conditions while also serving institutional goals. In doing so, this thesis argues that the implementation of QRIS is a negotiation process that involves trade-offs, offering benefits to some actors while presenting challenges or limitations to the others. This thesis contributes to the discussion on technological implementation by demonstrating how the pursuit of efficient economic transactions, initiators’ interests, and contextual constraints interact to shape the trajectory and implications of a specific technology within a particular societal context.","Master Philosophy of Science, Technology and Society (M-PSTS)",Adi Agustha Yudha,August 2025,English,"No.

However, the implementation of NBS involves complex stakeholder interactions, which can cause governance challenges to collaborative outcomes. This thesis explores how governance-related factors, including communication, trust, commitment, shared understanding, and intermediate outcomes affect stakeholder collaboration in an NBS project in Taiwan. The Zhongguakeng Creek restoration project serves as a case study because it is the first to sign a Letter of Intent for Resilient Hillslope Subsidy Negotiation, promoting the resilience slope policy. Eight semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants, including governmental officials, landowners, and consultants specializing in engineering, hydrology and ecology. The study applies the collaborative governance framework (Ansell & Gash, 2007) to analyze the collaboration process of the project. The finding reveals that effective collaboration depended on continuous communication, responses to local concerns, and trust built through long-term engagement. Although stakeholders initially had different priorities, they gradually developed a shared understanding of the goals through negotiation. Intermediate outcomes, such as ecological improvements and public recognition, strengthened stakeholder motivation and contributed to the launch of the project’s second phase.

This study aimed to examine the relationship between the maternal relationship, that is, the relationship participants had or continue to have with their own mothers, the mental well-being of the participants, and how this may be associated with their experiences of motherhood, defined here as participants’ current or future roles and experiences as mothers to their own children. A mixed-methods design was used, combining data from 150 mothers who completed standardized online surveys and open-ended narrative responses. Quantitatively, participants completed the Mental Health Continuum–Short Form (MHC-SF) and a validated scale measuring maternal relationship quality. Results showed a significant positive association between the quality of the maternal relationship and participants’ mental well-being. Qualitative findings provided deeper insights into the participants' emotional lives, revealing a wide range of emotional narratives that included reflections on childhood experiences with their mothers, and the redefinition of their own maternal roles. Many women described finding deep meaning and satisfaction in motherhood despite challenging or painful maternal histories. Together, the results suggest that while the maternal relationship shapes mental well-being and motherhood experiences, it does not solely determine these experiences. Broader interpersonal, cultural, and generational factors also play a critical role in shaping motherhood experiences.

108267,Behind the Blank Spot:  The Discursive Translation of Baduy Non-Use in Indonesia’s Digital Nation-Building,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108267,"This thesis is prompted by the first formally recognized instance of deliberate disconnection in Indonesia’s digital transformation agenda. In this context, internet access is framed as a universal necessity and an instrument of progress and nation-building, promoted through “internetification” programs. Amidst this push, the Indigenous Baduy Dalam community recently requested that their territory be designated as an internet “blank spot.” This request was accommodated by the government, challenging the assumption that connectivity is universally beneficial and offering an important empirical case for analyzing the relations between the government and Indigenous communities in Indonesia. Guided by the main research question: “How is the Baduy community’s refusal of internet connectivity understood, negotiated, and accommodated within Indonesia’s digital governance framework?”,I employed the Sociology of Knowledge Approach to Discourse (Keller, 2011; 2013) to identify multiple meanings of the internet across actor groups, drawing on semi-structured interviews and field observations. The analysis shows that while some meanings remained internal to specific groups, others circulated through processes of translation, giving rise to three discourse coalitions: a nation-building coalition framing the internet as a driver of integration and development; an adat-sovereignty coalition viewing it as a violation of sacred order and a source of external threat; and an intermediary coalition, composed of journalists, local experts, local officials, and activists, bridging the two through translation. The intermediary coalition enabled the blank spot accommodation by translating the Baduy’s cosmologically grounded refusal into a rationale of moral protection and visibility risk, more closely aligned with the national government’s narratives. This translation allowed the refusal to be accepted as a culturally sensitive adaptation within the digital nation-building agenda, but in doing so, it stripped the refusal of its ontological depth. The result is a fragile discursive compromise, the success of which depends on how it is interpreted by different actors. This outcome reflects broader relational dynamics between Indigenous communities and the Indonesian government, which rest on a fragile equilibrium of partial inclusion contingent on alignment with dominant imaginaries and conditional recognition. From these findings, there is a need for digital governance frameworks that recognize refusal as a legitimate stance, rather than subsuming Indigenous worlds into a singular vision of progress. I therefore call for the acknowledgement of ontological non-use in policy, which refers to refusal rooted in fundamentally different worldviews about technology’s place in life. This concept opens possibilities for sovereignty grounded in ontological differences and redefines user-technology relations, which, in turn, can contribute to a more contextualized digital transformation agenda based on a pluriversal approach.

This thesis assesses water-related risks in a global portfolio of hotel destinations operated by a multinational tourism company, focusing on high-risk locations and the applicability of the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Standard in guiding equitable and context-sensitive water management. Using a mixed-method approach, the study integrates quantitative screening using the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and the World Wide Fund for Nature’s Water Risk Filter with qualitative desk research and an operational risk questionnaire. The PRR framework, covering physical, regulatory, and reputational risks is used to structure the analysis. From 361 destinations across 37 countries, a total of 25 in five high-risk countries (Spain, Greece, Turkey, Mexico, and Egypt) were selected based on water risk severity and operational significance. Detailed basin- and site-level assessments revealed critical vulnerabilities including extreme baseline water stress, high seasonal variability, inadequate governance capacity, and reputational risks linked to water equity concerns. The AWS Standard offers a strong and flexible framework for site- and catchment-level action but requires adaptation to tourism-specific contexts.

108265,Governing the Hydrogen Transition: Hydrogen Valley case in the Northern Netherlands,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108265,"As the global energy transition accelerates, hydrogen valleys have emerged as critical governance models for developing integrated hydrogen economies. However, the complex governance structures in a hydrogen valley present significant challenges for effective implementation, requiring coordinated public and private stakeholders across different scales. The thesis examines the governance of the hydrogen transition through the Hydrogen Valley in the Northern Netherlands, and the main research question is “How is the hydrogen transition governed in the Hydrogen Valley of the Northern Netherlands, and what insights about the governance of the Hydrogen Valley can be drawn for facilitating regime shifts towards the hydrogen economy in other contexts?”. The HEAVENN project, the first and only hydrogen valley initiative in the Northern Netherlands, is selected as the case study for this research to address the research questions. The study employs a qualitative research design, incorporating seven semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders and an analysis of relevant documents to facilitate a comprehensive investigation. Later, the study applies a mixed theoretical approach that combines the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) framework to analyze socio-technical hydrogen transition dynamics. The research further utilizes the Governance Assessment Tool (GAT) to evaluate the governance effectiveness across five dimensions (Levels and Scales, Actors and Networks, Problem Perspectives and Goal Ambitions, Strategies and Instruments, and Responsibilities and Resources) and four quality criteria (Extent, Coherence, Flexibility, and Intensity). In the MLP analysis, green hydrogen production is represented as a niche innovation in the developmental phase, fostering experimentation in the Hydrogen Valley and regional network in the Northern Netherlands. However, the interactions between niche and regime reveal tensions for several reasons. Resistance from established regime, such as an immature market and insufficient financial incentives, impedes the niche growth. The GAT evaluation demonstrates strong governance extent through broad stakeholder involvement, but moderate intensity and coherence because of the conflict between national and regional support. A weakness exists in flexibility due to a fixed timeline and a limited project budget. Drawing from interviews and document analysis, the key barriers in this case include the persistent “chicken-and-egg” problem of simultaneous supply and demand development, infrastructure dependency, and policy alignment challenges. These issues reflect the research questions on governance challenges, indicating a need for coordinated strategies to bridge niche-regime-landscape interactions. Recommendations for other regions aiming to develop similar hydrogen initiatives include flexible governance, versatile infrastructure, and a balanced hydrogen value chain to address political and economic challenges. The findings provide a governance blueprint for the hydrogen transition by offering actionable strategies and underscore the necessity for adaptive governance frameworks to bridge the gap between long-term transition goals and short-term implementation challenges.

108263,GenAI Implementation in German Public Administration – Drivers & Barriers,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108263,"Generative AI (GenAI) is perceived as increasingly relevant to public administration organisations thanks to its potential benefits, for instance in serving as a remedy to staff shortages and bureaucratic workloads. Drawing on the qualitative analysis of 22 semi-structured interviews with public administration employees and consultants, this thesis identifies factors, drivers, and barriers of GenAI implementation in the context of German public administration. The findings confirm the relevance of factors present in previous research on implementation of general AI technology, such as change management, digital infrastructure, data quality, and regulation, while also pointing to additional factors either specific to GenAI implementation or the German administration context: First, the majority of the experts emphasised the perceived internal pressure by employees to use GenAI solutions in order to fulfil their professional tasks, based on positive experience in using relevant tools in their everyday life. Second, the expected benefit (often leading to additional external pressure), a close fit between GenAI's capabilities and administrative tasks as well as the accessibility of ready-made tools are perceived as drivers. Third, effective change management and transparent communication, paired with opportunities for creative experimentation, seem to be especially crucial when it comes to implementing this type of technology. Finally, digital sovereignty concerns and dependency on non-European providers were deemed to be GenAI-specific barriers. Barriers specific to the decentralised organisation of public administration in federal Germany include administrative, legal, and tendering requirements as well as a perceived lack of central guidance. Conversely, external collaboration among public sector organisations of all levels – openly sharing best practices, guidelines, and even applications – acts as a distinctive driver, often arising without formal top-down incentives. Theoretically this thesis sharpens the understanding of GenAI in public administration by identifying drivers and barriers that are specific to GenAI and to the German context. Practically, these results can guide practitioners and project teams on what to prioritise and what to mitigate. They also highlight system-level factors for governments and policymakers to address.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Eckert, L.",August 2025,English,"No

108262,Potential Strategies to Enhance the Implementation of Ship-Based Carbon Capture as an Energy Transition Option in the Europe,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108262,"This research is studying the implementation strategy for a niche technology of Ship-Based Carbon Capture (SBCC) in supporting the energy transition in the maritime sector in the European region. As a niche technology, SBCC is facing multiple barriers to being implemented widely due to other competing niche technologies as well as existing conventional technology in the maritime sector. With its huge potential in the maritime sector, it is important to find a strategy to overcome the barriers. The Multi-Level Perspective (MLP), Strategic Niche Management (SNM), and Clean Energy Technology Investment Attractiveness Scan (CETIAS) are being used for an in-depth analysis in finding a strategy to solve the barriers and have a wide implementation of SBCC. The data to support this research were collected through a literature review for the secondary data and interview, survey and workshop with the related stakeholders for the primary data. From 35 literatures, 13 interview sessions, 14 survey respondents, and a workshop with 7 stakeholders, a total of 16 barriers were identified. Based on the importance, the top 5 barriers are Supporting Policy, Technology Regulation, Infrastructure Availability, TCO of SBCC Technology, and Technology Readiness. It is supported by the trend of the barriers over the past 3 years, where all the barriers are kept repeating, except for Technology Readiness, that already become less priority. In solving these barriers, identified stakeholders with high influence are the Shipowner, Government, and Research Organizations. After analysing the data, some proposed initial strategies are establishing a specific policy for SBCC on an international scale, having a technology regulation agreement across nations, and constructing supporting infrastructure. Some additional strategies include having details of the amine type in capturing CO2, classification of captured CO2, and exploring CO2potential for synthetic fuel. Out of several proposed strategies, the workshop with stakeholders concluded that solving the Supporting Policy as the main barriers have to be prioritized. To solve this, modifications to GFI under IMO policy are suggested. A timeline between 2025 and 2027 that consists of 7 steps is proposed to support the modification, considering both the IMO MEPC agenda and the time range viability assessment. After the supporting policy barrier is solved, the focus needs to be continued with the other barriers, which can be solved by following the rest of the initial and additional strategies. The rest of the implementation strategies needs to be conducted and assessed within the time range viability of short-term of 5 years and long-term of 25 years. Besides that, it is also recognized that the current geopolitical events might affect the efforts to solve the barriers, which make the targeted timeline might not executed ideally on time.

This thesis analyze the development of CCUS niches in the Netherlands and Indonesia by employing the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) and Strategic Niche Management (SNM) frameworks in order to analyze the barriers and opportunities. Porthos (TRL 8, 2.5 Mtpa) and Aramis (TRL 9, up to 22 Mtpa) in the Netherlands. These advanced CCS projects in TRL 8-9 in the Netherlands have positive policy and market conditions, including SDE++ subsidies and the EU ETS, and are supported by a strong network effort. Nevertheless, the high costs as well as public opposition and infrastructure challenges will delay the deployment, in particular of the still less mature CCU technologies (TRL 3-8). Indonesia, which has huge storage opportunities (400-600 Gt), is promoting CCUS by means of oil and gas activities such as Tangguh and Sukowati TRL 3-6, guided by regulations that include Presidential Regulation No. 14/2024 and MEMR Regulation 2/2023. The obstacles include large investment costs, the regulatory gap, the low level of public awareness, and technological deficiencies. MLP emphasizes how global climate demands (such as the Paris Agreement) shape regime transitions, as illustrated by the mature, market-oriented Netherlands system coexisting with the centralized, external-influenced Indonesian governance. SNM uncovers the alignment of stakeholders via collaborative platforms in the Netherlands and the coordinated intervention by the government in Indonesia. The barriers are economic non-viability and social opposition, while the opportunities are from the North Sea storage of the Netherlands and the potential for a regional hub in Indonesia. This paper helps to develop transition theory by demonstrating how economic maturity, governance, and resource play into CCUS niches us advising on analytical approaches that include geopolitical and cultural dimensions. Such recommendations include: a longitudinal scaling of the niche investigation, public perception investigation, and cross-border financing model exploration to increase CCUS deployment.

The findings reveal that sensing is largely externally driven, with environmental aspects receiving more attention than social and governance dimensions. Seizing is constrained by dominant financial logic, limiting sustainability initiatives without clear economic returns. Transformation efforts remain programmatic and lack deep cultural embedding.

108259,Assessing Emotion Regulation and Coping Using Experience Sampling: A Scoping Review of Measures and Psychometric Properties,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108259,"Background.Regulatory processes, like emotion regulation (ER) and coping, are essential for our overall health and daily functioning. Increasingly, they have been investigated using experience sampling methods (ESM), which account for their dynamic nature by collecting real-time data. Knowing how regulatory processes are conceptualised and measured in daily life is essential for understanding their dynamicity and advancing theory. Therefore, the current study examined which regulatory strategies have been investigated using ESM, how they have been operationalised and how reliable they are.Methods.Three databases were searched to collect data for the present scoping review. Studies investigating regulatory strategy choice in relation to contextual or personality factors using ESM were included. The data were screened with a co-screener, extracted and grouped to reduce redundancies and more accurately reflect strategy inclusion.Results.44 studies were explored, identifying cognitive reappraisal (70%), suppression (59%) and perseverative cognitions (59%) as the most investigated strategies. Most commonly, single-item measures that were adapted from preexisting retrospective scales were used to assess regulatory strategies, and psychometric evaluation was typically assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). However, 43% failed to report reliability and 91% validity, revealing a significant lack in basic psychometric evaluation.Conclusions.Findings indicate that the overall reporting quality and psychometric evaluation need to be improved. It is suggested that future research focus on developing a more standardised conceptual foundation and a more dynamic approach to measuring regulatory strategies. Finally, psychometric evaluations need to be more rigorous, transparent, and utilise ESM-appropriate tools to guide research to progressively develop an ESM-appropriate measure for regulatory processes.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Dudde, A.M.",August 2025,English,"No.

108258,Consent or Concern? The Role of Privacy Cynicism and Online Privacy Literacy in the Privacy Decision-Making Process in E-commerce,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108258,"Recent advances in technology have enabled e-commerce platforms to collect, store, analyze, use, sell and share individuals’ personal data to tailor their online experience. However, personalization in e-commerce leads to privacy concerns and diminishes trust. Despite these privacy concerns, individuals seem to take minimal action to engage in privacy protection behavior. Recent studies explored the role of privacy cynicism in the privacy decision making process as it may decrease the extent to which individuals are motivated to protect their online privacy. The discrepancy between privacy concerns and privacy protection behavior might also be explained by a lack of knowledge and skills. Therefore, the present study aims to explore the role of privacy cynicism and online privacy literacy in the privacy decision-making process through the lens of the protection motivation theory. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect quantitative data from 348 participants in the Netherlands. The dependent variable privacy protection behavior was measured alongside variables derived from the protection motivation theory, including perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, perceived benefits, self-efficacy, response efficacy, and response costs. Additionally, the variables privacy cynicism and online privacy literacy were measured. The results of this study reveal that perceived benefits and self-efficacy have an effect on privacy protection behavior. Interestingly, the study found no moderating effect of privacy cynicism but did find cynicism to be a direct predictor of privacy protection behavior. Additionally, the study found that online privacy literacy has a direct effect on privacy protection behavior but does not mitigate privacy cynicism. This study highlightsthe importance of mitigating privacy cynicism and increasing online privacy literacy to motivate individuals to adopt protective measures.Both privacy cynicism and online privacy literacy should be addressed when aiming to increase privacy protection behavior.Educators and policymakers should develop interventions that combine factual and procedural knowledge.When individuals perceive that adopting protective behavior is effective, it may decrease feelings of powerlessness, uncertainty and resignation.In addition,e-commerce platforms shouldtake accountability and make adopting privacy protection behavior easier, convenient and more accessible to motivate individuals to engage in protective behavior.",Master Communication Science (M-COM),"Terwel, K.E.",August 2025,English,"No.

Second, MOSUM statistics with theoretically justified bandwidth selection are applied to detect change points in these regularized sequences. We establish asymptotic properties including Gumbel convergence of the hybrid MOSUM statistic under weak dependence assumptions and describe the short-range dependence of turning rate errors.

Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) addresses this challenge by promoting urban growth around public transport hubs and the diversification of land-use. This thesis customises a cellular automata land-use model (SIMLANDER) and develops supplementary “traceback” scripts to assess the potential impacts of TOD policies in the Rome metropolitan area. The modelling is supported by GIS analysis in QGIS and post-processing in Google Sheets, enabling spatial evaluation of affected areas and quantification of potential decarbonisation. Four scenarios were simulated: BASE, Balanced (BAL), Retrofit (RETRO), and Intense Building (IB). Results show that TOD scenarios can reduce carbon emissions by a minimum of 11.45% through decreased car use, and up to 50.40% when combined with green infrastructure such as green rooftops.

One critical concern in SDNs is the occurrence of race hazards across the communication between network components. These races can adversely affect network performance and stability, making it essential to detect and understand their root causes. Although various SDN verification tools are available, few effectively address race hazards detection across both the control and data planes. Tracer is one such tool designed to statically detect race hazards in SDNs by leveraging the symbolic semantics of DyNetKAT, a domain-specific language with a robust equational theory. However, Tracer’s initial implementation lacks performance benchmarks and thorough validation, limiting its practical utility. This study continues the work laid out for Tracer, making several key contributions to the detection of race hazards in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). We formalize three distinct types of harmful SDN race hazards and optimize the DyNetKAT symbolic semantics to enable their detection. To model network behavior more effectively, we apply the ""One Big Switch"" abstraction to the data plane. Additionally, we enhance the communication modeling between the control and data planes in DyNetKAT through a mechanism inspired from the OpenFlow protocol. We also present one of the first performance benchmark for DyNetKAT using a dataset of real world network topologies. Finally, we develop RaceLoom, a new implementation of Tracer capable of detecting harmful SDN race hazards, and benchmark its performance.

108253,Schema-Based Synthetic Knowledge Graph Generation Using AI Techniques,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108253,"Accessing real-world data is often problematic due to privacy concerns, especially in sen- sitive domains. As a result, synthetic data is increasingly used as a proxy for real data. However, most current approaches to synthetic data generation still rely heavily on access to real datasets. These methods typically analyze real data to extract distributions and feature relationships. Synthetic data are used not only to train generative models but also to test infrastructure and tools, produce real-world analysis over sensitive data. Common techniques like domain adaptation mostly treat synthetic data as a source context and apply trained models to real-world target contexts. These approaches are valuable for augmenting limited datasets or enabling training in virtual environments; yet, they remain fundamentally dependent on real data. This dependency can introduce privacy risks. In many cases even limited exposure to real datasets may lead to model memorization of out- liers or unique data points. As a result, the development of domain-independent, privacy- preserving synthetic data generators remains a critical challenge. Recent work has begun exploring synthetic data generation from data schema constraints alone, without access to any real samples. However, these efforts often fail to capture the complex interrelation- ships and statistical distributions found in real data. This thesis introduces SRDF-GEN1 as a web-based synthetic RDF data generator to investigate a novel domain-independent approach to generating high-fidelity synthetic RDF data, using AI data generation models. This approach is specifically guided by SHACL constraints, with the goal of maintaining structural and semantic coherence while safeguarding data privacy.

Hence, the research question that drove this work was“What are the enablers for the supply chain of recycled plastics necessary to facilitate the use of these materials instead of virgin materials in the Netherlands?”The report examines key instruments, including national and EU mandates for recycled content and recovery rates, and assesses the coherence of these measures with circular economy goals. Special attention is given to the concept of End of Waste (EoW) status, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), and Circular Economy (CE). A comparative policy analysis is conducted to evaluate differences in support mechanisms, particularly regarding energy pricing and standards of recycled plastics across EU member states, and financial incentives for Dutch industry to shift to recycled plastics. Additionally, this report integrates stakeholder insights, gathered from authorities’ publications, expert interviews and corporations’ reports, to examine operational and regulatory challenges. The research highlights critical interactions between policy, market, and corporate responsibility by focusing on fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in the beverage and non-food sectors. The study reveals that despite operating under the same EU regulatory landscape, the recycling industry pointed to the fragmentation in the legal framework and a market that remains insufficiently prepared. These findings underline the need for a unified regulatory approach tailored to recycled plastics, particularly around EoW status, and stable policy mandates, alongside stronger incentives that support uptake across the value chain.

The Bi-LSTM predicts next-day generation and demand at 15-minute intervals. These forecasts feed a synchronous double-auction mechanism run by a community coordinator, setting dynamic prices and matching buy and sell orders.

This study introducesimplicit self-compassion(ISC), a novel construct grounded in the Reflective-Impulsive Model, which suggests SC and ISC operate through distinct cognitive systems. The study further explored the relationship between ISC and automatic thoughts (ATs), including both negative (NATs) and positive (PATs) patterns. A pre-post experimental design was employed, with 54 participants assigned to either an experimental group receiving a three-day cognitive bias modification (CBM) training or a control group. The novel ISC was measured by developing an Implicit Association Test (IAT), while NATs and PATs were assessed with validated self-report questionnaires. SC and ISC do not seem to be related constructs (r=-.19,p>.05). The CBM could not reveal any significant changes in SC (b= .02,SE= .06,t(50.27) = .39,p= .70) nor ISC (b= .15,SE= .11,t(47.88) = 1.41,p= .17). Linear mixed-effects models and mediations could not yield any relationship between the ISC, ATs, or change promoted by the CBM (p>.05).

While the Netherlands is internationally recognized for large-scale water management innovations, island contexts such as Texel require more adaptive, small-scale, and integrated approaches, to for instance deal with local regulations regarding surface water use. The research addresses the problem that despite growing interest in circular water solutions, governance structures may not be sufficiently equipped to support their implementation. Using governance assessment criteria and circular economy principles, the study explores the island’s preparedness for adopting circular strategies in water management. Drawing on document analysis and eight semi-structured interviews, it examines how governance structures, stakeholder collaboration, policy tools, and resource allocation shape this readiness. The findings reveal that while various actors are involved and pilot projects exist, the governance structure remains fragmented, responsibilities are often unclear, and policy tools favor incremental change over transformative change. Despite the local willingness to innovate, structural cross-sectoral coordination, long-term monitoring, and specific financing mechanisms are limited.

108239,Satellite Orbit Prediction using Machine Learning,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108239,"Accurate long-term satellite orbit prediction is critical for space operations but remains challenging due to unmodeled perturbations and accumulating errors in physics-based propagators. This thesis investigates whether AI models can improve prediction accuracy by learning residual errors caused by physical propagators directly from historical data. We assess how modeling strategies, input representations (Cartesian vs. Keplerian), and sequential architectures of the chosen models (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Transformer Encoder (TE)) influence prediction accuracy across multiple propagation horizons. The models are trained on historical orbital datasets and evaluated using Euclidean distance position error over 3-, 5-, 10-, and 30-day horizons, using either an iterative prediction or iterative propagation framework, where in the latter the predictions are corrected by iteratively propagating between timesteps. Results show that sequential variants of each model type outperform their non-sequential counterparts, with the performance gap increasing for longer prediction horizons. Cartesian inputs consistently lead to lower prediction errors than Keplerian elements across all architectures. Additionally, we found that the accuracy of orbit prediction depends on both the type of object and its orbital regime: models achieve lower errors for space debris and rocket bodies, which typically lack station-keeping maneuvers, compared to active payloads. These findings highlight the importance of using sequential architectures and Cartesian inputs when modeling long-term orbital error, and demonstrate that orbit characteristics such as object type and regime play a substantial role in the predictability of future positions. Furthermore, prediction performance is better for satellites in MEO than those in LEO or VLEO, indicating that the choice of orbital regime influences the learnability of residual dynamics. Among the models, Transformer-based architecture shows strong performance for capturing long-term dependencies, and a 85.5 meter 30-day improvement over the analytical physical propagator SGP4.

108233,Deep Learning based Crevasses Detection using Multi-Modal SAR Images,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108233,"Crevasses serve as indicators of stress and flow in ice masses and are critical for modeling glacier stability and assessing risks for both scientific expeditions and infrastructure in glaciated regions. Accurate detection of glacier crevasses is essential for understanding ice dynamics, improving glacier hazard assessments and supporting field navigation in glacial environments. While deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for crevasse mapping, limited work has focused on how different Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor platforms, particularly airborne versus spaceborne systems, affect detection performance. This study compares the effectiveness of airborne UAVSAR and spaceborne Sentinel-1 SAR data for deep learning-based crevasse detection using a U-Net segmentation model. Four experimental scenarios were developed by varying platform type, polarization mode (quad pol vs. dual-pol) and spatial resolution (5 m vs. 10 m). Manually digitized crevasse masks served as ground truth for model training and evaluation in glaciated regions of Iceland. Results showed that the UAVSAR platform, especially in its quad-polarized 5 meter configuration, achieved the best performance across all metrics, with visually accurate delineation of crevasse features. The dual-pol UAVSAR model also performed reasonably well, though with slightly lower precision. In contrast, the generalization of the model in terms of spatial resolution showed limitations when experimenting with Sentinel-1 dual-pol data at 10 m resolution resulted in weak backscatter contrast over glaciated surfaces, making it difficult for the model to distinguish narrow or fragmented crevasses. These findings highlight the critical importance of both spatial resolution and platform characteristics: airborne SAR data with high spatial fidelity and richer polarimetric content enable more reliable crevasse detection, while coarse-resolution spaceborne data like Sentinel-1 introduce major limitations in feature separability. The study underscores the value of airborne SAR systems for high precision glacier mapping and offers a comparative framework for future platform-specific SAR applications in cryosphere research.Keywords: Crevasse detection, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Deep learning, U-Net, UAVSAR, Sentinel-1, Airborne vs. Spaceborne, Glacier mapping, Polarization, Spatial resolution",Master Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (M-GEO-WO),"Nadeem, H.",July 2025,English,"No.

108228,Effects of Temperature and Irradiance on Contact Resistance in Photovoltaic Cells,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108228,"Contact and sheet resistance are key contributors to losses in silicon solar cells, and their accurate extraction is essential for cell optimisation. The Transmission Line Method (TLM) is a standard technique for determining these parameters, but it is traditionally applied under dark conditions and assumes linearity in the total resistance versus contact spacing (RT vs d) relationship. In real-world operation, solar cells are exposed to illumination and elevated temperatures, which introduce diode-like nonlinearities and disrupt lateral current flow. This thesis investigates the influence of irradiation and temperature on TLM measurements using a solar simulator and temperature-controlled chuck. Results show that an increase in temperature caused a significant rise in contact resistance- over 300% at 70°C, and moderate increases in specific contact resistivity, sheet resistance and transfer length. In contrast, the extraction of device parameters under irradiation could not provide absolute results, due to nonlinearities in measurement data, but showed an increase in contact resistance and a decrease in sheet resistance. Furthermore, to address the breakdown of classical TLM assumptions under illumination, an empirical model was developed to compensate for the non-linear bending in the RT vs d curves. This correction enables semi-quantitative extraction of sheet resistance and transfer length under moderate irradiance. However, at higher light intensities, the model produced unphysical values for contact resistance, revealing its limitations. Overall, this work demonstrates the environmental sensitivity of resistance measurements and provides a framework for extending TLM applicability under realistic operating conditions.

108226,AI Enhanced Facility Layout Optimization,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108226,"Throughout the last 20 years, the increased demand of customised products and services has affected many industries. Particularly manufacturing industry has gone through a trans- formation driven by Industry 4.0 with the demand of more efficient and adaptable production systems and workflows. Despite the technological advancements, many of the manufactur- ing companies still rely on manual, experience based approaches for facility layout planning. This results in suboptimal designs that impacts the productivity, energy consumption and operational costs. This challenge affected the competitive corrugated cardboard industry specifically due to complex material flows, diverse product mixes and multiple processing stages creating a complex optimisation problem that exceeds human cognitive capabilities. This experimental research addresses the facility layout optimization problem at a cor- rugated cardboard manufacturer where the current manual trial and error based approach requires weeks and months of iterative design cycles leading to inefficient layouts with un- predictable performance. To address these challenges this paper investigates the following research question: how AI enhanced generative design can be leveraged to optimize through- put in custom cardboard facility layouts while integrating with existing design workflows and simulation tools. With this research question a hybrid genetic algorithm based opti- mization system that combines NSGA-II with two tier evaluation pipeline was developed. This system employs process level gene encoding to reduce the search space, integrating A* pathfinding for spatial validation and using both surrogate model and discrete event simula- tion for fitness assessment. This approach aims to generate multiple Pareto optimal layouts balancing infrastructure costs (total conveyor length) and operational efficiency (throughput and path ratio). Experimental results and evaluation demonstrates that this developed system serves primarily as a proof-of-concept for AI-enhanced layout optimisation rather than a deployable industrial solution. The results show a reduction in the conveyor length and improvements in throughput optimisation. However the evaluation remains constrained by several reasons: the system was tested against a ”golden layout” only reference layout provided by industrial partner for comparison purposes and due to lack of complexity of the system the real factory layout’s could not be used in comparison. Component variety is limited to seven transport systems and extensive parameter tuning is required. The future development should focus on increasing the complexity by integrating all the transport system component that it can be validated against a real full scaled factory layout, as scaling with the NSGA-III so that it can be customised with more objectives and not only two and integrating with real time operational data.",Bachelor Creative Technology (B-CREA),"Bezek, Y.",October 2025,English,"No.

108225,Transformation of  Attack-Defense Trees into  2-player Game Automata,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108225,"Attack-Defense Trees (ADTs) are widely used for modeling dynamic interactions between a potential system attacker and the system’s defender. They offer a structured and intuitive approach to quantitative analysis, enabling the identification of threats and the evaluation of defense strategies using various attributes. However, many existing approaches to ADT analysis suffer from a significant limitation—the restricted expressiveness of the models, which hinders in-depth analysis of ADTs. This creates a scientific gap in the field of cybersecurity and system analysis. This thesis aims to address this gap by developing a novel generative tool that automates the creation of ADT models into PRISM code for formal verification. The tool will support both tree-structured and DAG-structured ADTs with cost metrics. Using this tool, it will be possible to conduct in-depth analysis of the trees, identify potential vulnerabilities, and model hypothetical scenarios for their prevention.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Fedorov, K.",August 2025,English,"No

108218,Involuntarily Speaking Your Mind : Difficulties in Determining Blame for Technologically Revealed ‘Inner Speech’,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108218,"Researchers are currently developing speech neuroprostheses—devices that aim to restore speaking abilities to individuals who have lost them due to paralysis. Some of these devices work by detecting and decoding neural activity associated with phonemes in a user's 'inner speech', and then producing an audible output that others can hear. This approach poses a significant risk: inner speech utterances that users intended to keep private may be unintentionally revealed to others. In this thesis, I develop two difficulities with holding users morally responsibile for these revealed utterances. First, I argue that it is difficult to determine whether a user had sufficient control over an inner speech utterance to be responsible for it. Second, I argue that it is difficult to determine the meaning of an inner speech utterance based solely on what the device reveals. I conclude that these two difficulities provide a particular problem for establishing a practice of blame against 'intrinsic mental wrongdoing', which are cases where establishing the intentions behind an inner speech utterance are most important.","Master Philosophy of Science, Technology and Society (M-PSTS)","Brady, A.B.",August 2025,English,"No

108215,Modeling Urban Floods in  D-Hydro With Two Types of  Sewer System Schematizations  and Varying Climate Scenarios,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108215,"Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events, including short, intense rainfall that raises the risk of pluvial flooding in urban areas. Although riverine floods often draw more attention, frequent urban pluvial floods can cause comparable societal impacts. With urbanization and climate change increasing the frequency and severity of these events, there is an urgent need for effective mitigation strategies. Numerical flood models are essential for developing such strategies, as they simulate complex urban flow dynamics. A key aspect of these dynamics is the integration of sewer systems. However, how these systems are represented in models varies widely, from simplified parametrized approaches to more physically explicit networks. This variation, combined with rising climate risks, has led to a lack of a comprehensive evaluation of how sewer schematization influences flood outcomes, especially under different climate scenarios. This study aimed to evaluate and compare urban flood characteristics, specifically maximum flood extent and volume, simulated by a simplified and detailed sewer model. In the simplified model, the sewer system is represented through parameterization, incorporating semi-distributed spatial variability. The detailed model includes an explicit 1D sewer network. The study also examined the impact of different climate scenarios by incorporating both the older KNMI’14 and updated KNMI’23 projections, relating climate-induced uncertainty to the variations resulting from differences in sewer system schematizations. To achieve this, both simplified and detailed sewer system models were developed for the same urban case study of Overschie. The detailed model was provided by the commissioning party HydroLogic and the simplified model was created through a schematic abstraction of the detailed network and calibrated using observed water level data. Rainfall inputs were derived from the KNMI’14 and KNMI’23 climate scenarios, representing a plausible range of future extremes. In both models, surface flow modeling was conducted using a 1D modeling 2D post-processing approach. Surface flow was represented in 1D during the simulation, while flood extent and volume were computed through 2D post-processing. The results of this study demonstrate that flood characteristics in urban areas are influenced by both sewer schematization choice and the uncertainty introduced by climate scenarios. Simulations were conducted for different rainfall intensities (T2, T10, T100) and patterns (winter and summer). These revealed that the detailed model consistently produced higher flood volumes and extents during the winter period, while the simplified model showed higher values in two out of three summer simulations (T2 and T10). These differences were related to four key processes: spillage, overflow discharge, groundwater exchange, and surface runoff. Importantly, the level of sewer system schematization directly affected processes such as spillage and overflow discharge due to differing methodologies. However, it also influenced groundwater exchange and surface runoff, despite these being identically implemented. This highlights the interdependencies between the processes within the urban drainage systems. The study also compared flood outcomes based on the older KNMI’14 and updated KNMI’23 climate projections. Results showed that flood extent and volume closely reflected differences in rainfall input. On average, KNMI’23 produced slightly lower flood characteristics (–2.\% for volume and –3.07\% for extent). These differences increased over the future projected years, were more pronounced in the summer simulations, and were greater at the lower boundaries of the climate scenarios. In terms of uncertainty, model-related uncertainty remained relatively constant. It was only dominant in a few lower-intensity scenarios. In contrast, climate uncertainty increased over time and with more extreme rainfall scenarios. When climate uncertainty was dominant, it was substantially larger than when model uncertainty was dominant, highlighting its greater influence on flood characteristics in the future. This study demonstrates that both model and climate projection uncertainty influence flood characteristics. Their relative importance is context-specific and depends on the modeling objective and scenario. As such, urban flood adaptation strategies should consider both uncertainties and ensure that the chosen sewer schematization is appropriate for the intended analysis. Despite acknowledged limitations in methodology, interpretation, data, and generalizability, the study offers a clear comparative assessment of how sewer schematization and climate scenarios impact urban flood characteristics.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"Brinkers, R.A.",July 2025,English,"No

While initial research suggests a significant direct positive relationship between AI acceptance and entrepreneurial intention, empirical evidence remains scarce. Therefore, considering a broad theoretical foundation and contextual variables, this study addresses the question: Which effect does Behavioral Intention to use AI have on Entrepreneurial Intention? Employing a cross-sectional survey of 97 business students, the analysis incorporates Behavioral Intention to Use AI, AI Proficiency, contextual variables, and the constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior. The results indicate that neither Behavioral intention to Use AI nor AI Proficiency directly predict Entrepreneurial Intention. Instead, they likely take indirect influenceby shaping the key psychological drivers, Attitude toward the Behavior and Perceived Behavioral Control. The attitude toward entrepreneurship, and the perceived control over the venture creation process are reaffirmed as the most dominant predictors of Entrepreneurial Intention, while contextual variables show no significance.

108213,Assessing the environmental impact of packaging during product development to ensure well-considered decision-making,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108213,"One of the main challenges in today’s grocery industry is the lack of clear understanding of how each part of the supply chain affects a product’s environmental impact. Not only are supermarkets responsible for lowering the impact of a product, but all the different segments of the chain like the manufacturers, suppliers, consumers, and others play a role. To improve this understanding, more insight is needed into the total environmental impact of a product. By including more information about the environmental effects during production, use, and disposal during the product development process, some uncertainty about the product’s overall impact can be reduced. The aim of this research is to construct a method to analyze the impact of packaging during product development, instead of checking the impacts afterwards with an assessment method. In most cases in industry, an assessment is only performed to use the impact percentage to support their ‘environmental claims’ instead of improving the product to reduce even more impact. Therefore, the aim is:‘Assessing the environmental impact of packaging during product development to ensure well-considered decision-making’. The aim will offer the possibility to perform an impact assessment on a product during the development process and be critical to prevent decisions that lead to an unexpected environmental impact. After researching different approaches of product development processes and explaining a way to assess environmental impact by using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), a restructured product development model with an integration of LCA was made. The benefit of this integrated product development process is that the necessary steps of an LCA are performed simultaneously throughout the entire process. This approach provides valuable insight into the expected environmental impact of the new packaging throughout its life cycle. These insights will support the decision-making process to achieve better and well-founded decisions. All gathered information is then presented as a framework. It demonstrates how and when the LCA steps are used during the product development process. To evaluate the framework, a case study on the new packaging of HAK: HAK-in-PAK is performed, where the restructured product development model is used as a guidance to develop the product and the LCA steps to support well-thought-out decisions on the product itself.",Master Industrial Design Engineering (M-IDE),"Achterhof, E.",August 2025,English,"No

Whileprior research has established that mood states can influence consumer behaviour, thespecifics of positive affect’s influence on premium-branded purchasing remainunderexplored. The two research questions this study poses are: ‘What kind of influence domood states categorised as positive affect have on the amount of premium-branded food itemsbought compared to those categorised as negative affect?’, as well as ‘How do premiumbranded purchased items differ between positive and negative affect?’ A qualitative designwas employed using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) in combination with the PhotoDiary Method (PDM). A sample of seven university students reported their mood states andfood purchases for one week; they did this through an app on their mobile device. Mood wasmeasured using the Momentary Affect Scale (MAS), while their purchases were tracked bythe pictures the participants took of those purchases. At baseline, the Positive and NegativeAffect Schedule Short Form (PANAS-SF) provided background information on the sample’smean affective state. Purchases were coded in terms of brandedness and packagingcharacteristics (e.g., logo size, colour) using ATLAS.ti. Findings show that positive affect isnot correlated to a higher frequency of premium-branded food items purchased compared tonegative affect. Interestingly, premium-branded items purchased during positive affectexclusively featured either a large logo or brightly coloured packaging. As well as, purchasesin general increasing significantly during positive affect compared to negative affect. Whileparticipants’ post-study reflections were mixed regarding their awareness of affect influences,objective data showed a behavioural trend across the participants. This study providespreliminary support for the idea that positive affective states contribute to consumerpreference for premium food brands. This study showed that positive affect significantlyincreased overall food purchases, and when premium-branded foods have brightly colouredpackaging and large logos, they are preferred over blander alternatives. Regarding consumerpsychology, these insights indicate that marketers can leverage mood-inducing strategies,such as uplifting advertisement tones or in-store experiences, to possibly increase foodpurchases, particularly for food items with attention-grabbing packaging. This studyhighlights the added value of real-life behavioural measuring techniques like the ExperienceSampling Method and Photo Diary Method over retrospective surveys, by ensuring datacollection which provides consistent and rich data full of context. Future research shouldexpand to larger, more socio-economically diverse samples, examine long-term moodpurchase consistency, and explore distinctive mood states to possibly create emotionalpurchasing models.Keywords: positive affect, consumer behaviour, premium brands, food purchasing, moodstates, experience sampling method, photo diary method, packaging design, momentary affect,qualitative research",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Smink, W.T.A.",August 2025,English,"No.

108211,Stepram: Motorizing a manual device for MRI-guided prostate biopsies,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108211,"This thesis paper showcases the design, construction, and evaluation of the StepRAM, a motorized version of the Philips DynaTRIM device for MRI-guided prostate biopsies. The aim of the project was to motorize the original device without impeding on the autonomy of the operator by compromising patient safety or full human control. Full MR-Safety is ensured through the use of pneumatic stepper motors, which are fully 3D-printed using PLA. The motorization is focused on axes used for accurate positioning of the biopsy needle, and includes a manual override to satisfy ethical requirements of autonomy and fail-safe behaviour. In an iterativeprototyping process and a controlled evaluation, the StepRAM was tested for displacement accuracy, repeatability, and emergency procedures. Results indicate that the system performs close to clinical requirements of accuracy, and Axis 5 consistently meets the sub-millimeter accuracy requirement. While Axis 4 and 6 occasionally exceeded the 1.5mmlimit, their behaviour was stable and traceable back to mechanical backlash. The entire design process was guidedthrough an ethical framework that ensured safety, transparency and usability. The prototype demonstrates that low-cost, MR-safe motorized prostate biopsy devices are feasible and ethical, providing the basis for further research and clinical assessment.

Whilst the disclosures in the annual reports are mandatory by the SEC, it is unclear whether thesetypes of risk disclosures are useful to public investors or just boilerplate text that can be ignored. It is therefore also uncertain whether the policy updates made by the SEC regarding cybersecurity risk disclosure are taken serious by these companies. This study compares risk disclosuresin 10-K forms of 292 technology companies between 2014 and 2023. The risk disclosure sections are compared with eachother using cosine similarity and also compared to the SEC policy updates regarding cybersecurity risk disclosure. Furthermore, a Large Lnguage Model (LLM) is used to identify cybersecurity risks mentioned in these sections. Combining all this data withinformation about known cybersecurity incidents, shows that cybersecurity incidents do not affect the nature of cybersecurity risk disclosure in the analyzed companies.The SEC policy updates do have a positive effect on the nature of the disclosures.

There is a scarcity of accessible and reliable information about Long Covid, and when it is available, it is often difficult to find. For this reason, the Long Covid Toolkit was created to provide a digital platform for people with Long Covid, offering information about the disease and possible interventions. In order to maximize the accessibility, readability and comprehensibility of this website, this study focuses on how the organization and presentation of text on a website can be optimized. To achieve this, a qualitative study was conducted, involving six interviews with people with long Covid. The participants were sent three different texts in advance, which were discussed during the interview. This data was then analyzed thematically, using inductive coding on the themes of text length, layout types, medical terminology, sequence of headings, expectation and observation, labels and sources, which are explained in the results section. The analysis showed that the respondents indicated a preference for a layered information structure. This means that the texts should be short at first glance, with the option of clicking through to more detailed information. With regard to layout, it was indicated that bullet points, tables and clear headings can significantly increase readability and reduce cognitive load. Respondents also indicated that they appreciate medical terminology, but emphasized that it must remain understandable. Labels, small text boxes at the top of a website, like ‘recommended by general practitioners’,are considered very useful. But they have to be provided clearly visible and objectively. Finally, it was indicated that the availability of links to scientific literature increases reliability, even among those who have no interest in reading it. The conclusion is that a balance must be struck between reliability, structure and clarity. Visual design, flexibility in the provision of information and transparency play a major role in keeping the site readable, accessible and user-friendly.

This thesis introduces LOCKUD, a system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and ontologies to automate the construction of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) from unstructured data sources. The system was designed and evaluated using a real-world use case from general practitioner (GP) records, with the goal of improving data accessibility, organisational insight, and decision-making. The research follows the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) and addresses both technical and organisational performance indicators. Multiple KG construction approaches using LLM were compared, including prompt engineering, multi-model, and multiphase pipelines, based on metrics such as precision, recall, and ontology conformance. The LOCKUD solution demonstrated high accuracy in extracting relevant medical entities and relationships from journal entries and successfully integrated them into a structured, queryable KG. A custom-built dashboard further showcased the practical utility of the system by enabling semantic search, error detection, and data-driven exploration of GP activity. Feedback from stakeholders highlighted the potential for operational efficiency gains, although concerns about explainability, legal compliance, and model transparency were also noted. This work contributes a practical methodology, a validated system, and new insights into the integration of LLMs and semantic technologies.

A clinical dataset from OCON, comprising patient-reported symptoms and demographic variables, was used to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including LASSO logistic regression, Random Forest, and linear Support Vector Machines. The modeling pipeline included multiple imputation (MICE), class balancing techniques (SMOTE and downsampling), and nested cross-validation to ensure robust and unbiased evaluation. Despite outperforming random classification, model performance remained limited. Most models struggled to differentiate between diagnostic categories, often defaulting to the majority class. Only infection (X6) and arthrofibrosis/stiffness (X8) were somewhat more distinguishable, consistent with clinical expectations. The limited discriminative value of the available features, coupled with a relatively small and single-center dataset, likely contributed to the poor performance. Future research should focus on expanding the dataset with more informative variables (e.g., implant details, psychological factors, intraoperative findings) and exploring complementary approaches such as process mining to gain insights into diagnostic pathways.

While AFTs have the benefit of a unified analysis of accidental failures and malicious attacks, the existing quantitative analysis of AFTs overlooks the strategic decision-making by the attacker. 
This paper proposes a different method for analysing AFTs that translates AFTs into Markov decision processes. Our approach enables us to explore the optimal strategic choices an attacker can make and allows for a Pareto analysis of the possible trade-offs between the attacks' cost and likelihood of their success. To facilitate this, we define a translation procedure from AFTs to MDPs in the PRISM modelling language.

This thesis investigates motor synchrony and adaptive coordination in autistic and non-autistic adults using a two-task experimental paradigm involving real-time movement tracking and controlled perturbations. Task 1 focused on visually guided tracking and synchrony disruptions, enabling analysis of motor adaptation and recovery. Task 2, designed to probe leadership and role flexibility under asymmetric conditions, was implemented but remains unanalysed due to scope limitations. Using circular statistics and Continuous Relative Phase (CRP), we assessed baseline synchrony, recovery time, and coordination stability in Task 1. Contrary to expectations, autistic participants showed strong baseline synchrony and faster recovery from perturbations, suggesting intact or enhanced reactive control under low-complexity conditions. CRP variance, used to index coordination stability, revealed no significant group differences. These findings challenge deficit-oriented models and highlight the influence of task simplicity on observed behaviours. Methodologically, the study presents a technically grounded approach combining high-resolution motion capture with ecologically meaningful interaction design.

However, most participants in VR experiments experience a novelty effect, where the unfamiliarity of the VR interface causes an increased cognitive load. This results in behavioural differences between the same experiment conducted in VR or in real life. The aim of this project was to create an onboarding experience to introduce participants to VR, which can be used in future studies to study the novelty effect. 
During two evaluation sessions, 33 user sessions were held to give feedback on the VR Waiting Room. Between the first and second evaluation sessions, several improvements were outlined. Although these changes significantly improved participants’ scores for experienced realism, no other scores improved significantly. In fact, the scores for spatial presence and general presence decreased, though insignificantly. The scores for the visual realism of the environment also improved insignificantly. This suggests that the changes made to the environment had a positive impact, but it is not as significant as expected.

The aim is to improve forecasting accuracy using operational data such as carcass characteristics and production volumes.
A structured dataset of approximately 250 weekly observations was used to train and evaluate four machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Regression. A feature selection step was applied, and both full and reduced feature versions were tested, with model selection based on a multi-step strategy that prioritised low error and generalisability. All selected models successfully achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) below the 20% threshold set by the company’s management, as measured on the test set.
Interpretability analysis using SHAP revealed that total throughput and carcass weight were the most influential features across all targets, while seasonal features played a key role in predicting the more variable by-products. 
The study concludes with practical recommendations for deployment, focusing on data quality improvements, system integration with ERP infrastructure, user training, and continuous model maintenance.

108185,Developing an experimental setup to investigate radial size segregation of granular materials,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108185,"Segregation during mixing is a common issue when processing granular materials. This applies
to a myriad of different industries like pharmaceutical, agriculture and construction. It can cause
faults in the distribution of chemical components for medicine, or cause uneven distribution of
granular material in concrete thereby affecting the strength of the material.
While bi-dispersed mixtures with a 1:1 volume fraction are relatively well understood, both in
simulation and theory, the same does not apply for more complex mixtures. Diluted bi-dispersed
mixtures, generally with a volume fraction below 9:1, are poorly understood in comparison. Neither theory or simulation allow for accurate prediction of behavior during mixing. Even less is
known about multi-dispersed systems, where the presence of more than two particle sizes adds
further complexity.
In previous research a theoretical and numerical model was proposed focusing on a single intruder particle4, 5. This model was meant to research the forces causing segregation, and
extend the understanding of size segregation to all possible volume fractions in bi-dispersed mixtures. These forces are understood as a combination of a buoyancy force, resulting from packing
effects and a lift force, induced by the velocity field of the surrounding bulk particles. While
both theory and simulation for this model have shown consistent results, it awaits experimental
validation.
In this study, a novel experimental setup was developed to directly observe the dynamics of
a single intruder particle in a bulk of smaller particles. The setup consists of a transparent drum
with a horizontal axis of rotation and transparent hydro-gel particles, whose refractive index is
matched to that of the surrounding fluid as closely as possible. This enables visual tracking of
the dyed intruder particle throughout the entire bulk volume with a camera. This eliminates
the need for hazardous and complex methods, used in previous research, like lasers, X-rays, or
radioactive particles.
The setup provides a means to gather reliable experimental data to validate theoretical models.
Moreover it offers a simple and repeatable method for future research into more complex segregation behaviour. The diameter of the hydro-gel particles can be controlled during production,
making the system adaptable for studying a wide range of particle size distributions.
A fully functioning experimental setup was not achieved in this research. However, many key
concepts of the design have been proven to work. The produced particles show a high level of
dimensional accuracy (8.1). Complete refractive index matching turned out to be impossible for
this combination of PEGDA and Glycerol (8.3), which resulted in optical distortion. However
the intruder particle could still be tracked, provided that a shorter drum was used (8.4.1).
To validate the single particle model the intruder particles velocity and position must be tracked
accurately to compare with the forces proposed in the research. The optical distortion, caused by
the transparent particles, introduced too much noise to track this data accurately. Therefore, the
main improvement required for future research is the refractive index matching of the particles.
Either the particles or the fluid could be altered to achieve this. The use of a different polymer
for the particles can lower their refractive index value. The change in material could affect the
ease of production or the quality of the particles. The use of a different fluid with a higher
refractive index could provide a solution. But suitable fluids with a sufficiently high refractive
index are rare.",Master Mechanical Engineering (M-ME),"Fokke, Timo",August 2025,English,"No

sketches. Additionally, the components to interact with on the physical model were specified. A 
pen and paper test of the interfaces was done to gather feedback and validate the design before 
prototypes were created of both interfaces. These interfaces were then evaluated using

A lack of coordination leads to high variability in bed occupancy and frequent overflows to clinical wards, despite available resources. To mitigate this, a planning tool was developed that enables capacity aware surgical scheduling. The tool assigns surgeries to operating days and determines their order while explicitly accounting for day treatment capacity. This improves bed reuse, balances daily demand, and creates a more predictable workload for staff. Model results show a strong reduction in occupancy variability and a significant decrease in patient overflow, achieved without additional resources.

108180,"Integrating Environmental variable for Enhanced Cross-Regional Maize Crop Time Series Classification : A Case Study of Nyagatare, Rwanda",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108180,"Accurate and timely crop classification is crucial for agricultural monitoring and informed decision-making, especially in regions with limited access to ground-truth data. Sub-Saharan regions, including areas like Nyagatare District in Rwanda, face two major challenges in remote sensing-based crop mapping: data scarcity and temporal shift. Data scarcity refers to the lack of labeled samples needed to train machine learning models, while temporal shift arises due to differences in climate, crop calendars, and agricultural practices across regions, which leads to misaligned crop development timelines and reduced model accuracy. These limitations hinder the ability to develop reliable classification models using conventional supervised learning approaches. This study addresses both challenges by introducing a transferable maize classification method that leverages environmental similarities specifically temperature and precipitation between Europe (2018) and Rwanda (2020). The research aims to develop and evaluate a Random Forest classification model trained on environmentally matched European regions and applied to Nyagatare District. The main objective is supported by three sub-objectives: (i) to generate representative training samples from European croplands with climate conditions similar to Nyagatare; (ii) to train and optimize a Random Forest classifier using these samples; and (iii) to evaluate the model’s performance using a leave-one-region-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) strategy and apply it to the Nyagatare context. Seven regions across France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom were selected based on annual temperature (18–24°C) and precipitation (864–1474 mm) thresholds to reflect Nyagatare’s environmental conditions. Sentinel-2 imagery for 2018 (Europe) and 2020 (Nyagatare) was used, from which 368 spectral-temporal features were extracted using vegetation indices NDVI, EVI, SAVI, and NDWI and a sliding-window approach to capture phenological variability. A two-stage evaluation was implemented. First, leave-one-region-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) was used to assess the model’s generalizability across the European regions and identify the optimal hyperparameters. Then, the model was re-trained using the best-performing configuration and the complete training data from all four countries, and subsequently applied to Nyagatare. The results demonstrated robust model performance. The best LOO-CV fold achieved 88.0% accuracy, 92.0% recall, and an F1 score of 87.0%. When applied to Nyagatare, the model yielded 83.8% accuracy, 85.0% precision, 84.0% recall, and an F1 score of 84.0%. Feature importance analysis showed that sliding-window vegetation indices contributed most to prediction accuracy, confirming the value of capturing temporal dynamics. NDVI trend comparisons between Nyagatare and European farms confirmed phenological alignment, validating the environmental matching strategy. Despite its effectiveness, the study acknowledges limitations such as the use of only temperature and precipitation for matching, exclusion of other agronomic factors (e.g., soil type, crop variety, soil moisture), reliance on single-year data, and unresolved temporal misalignments. Nonetheless, the findings challenge the traditional emphasis on geographic proximity for transfer learning and suggest that environmental similarity offers a powerful alternative. This research contributes a scalable, cost-effective framework for crop mapping in data-scarce environments and supports global agricultural monitoring efforts aligned with Sustainable Development Goals particularly SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

Recent work has composed neuromorphic cores of both RISC-V processors and dedicated accelerators to ensure both flexibility and efficiency in terms of throughput and energy consumption.
 This work aims to optimize dedicated accelerators for RISC-V-based neuromorphic systems to improve their throughput and energy efficiency. To achieve the optimizations, an analysis is made of the fundamentals of neural networks along with the trade-offs and innovations of existing accelerators.
 An instruction set architecture is designed to efficiently represent the main computational operations of convolutional neural networks. The proposed co-processor is composed of a loop-optimized controller to exploit the recurrent patterns of neural networks and of a parallel array of processing elements that employ low-precision integer-only arithmetic. The level of quantization is based on a trade-off between computational efficiency and model accuracy. Finally, this work proposes two novel architectures to exploit weight sparsity in RISC-V-based neuromorphic systems. The co-processor is evaluated against a standalone RISC-V processor with VGG-16.
 Without exploiting weight sparsity, the co-processor achieves a speedup of 67x to 79x and a reduction in energy consumption of 22x to 28x over a standalone RISC-V processor at a cost of a 2.38% increase in area. At a weight sparsity of 80-86%, the co-processor achieves a speedup of 120x to 138x and a reduction in energy consumption of 53x to 61x over a standalone RISC-V processor at a cost of a 2.65% increase in area. The co-processor offers a competitive balance between area, energy efficiency, throughput, and flexibility compared to existing accelerators for RISC-V-based neuromorphic systems.
 As such, this work provides architectural decisions and quantifies their impact on the competitiveness of neuromorphic systems.

108177,Adoption of Planning support systems: With a case study in Urban Dynamic Maps(UDM) in Rwanda,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108177,"Rapidly urbanising regions are facing complex urban planning challenges, particularly in the Global 
South. As many countries around the world have found solutions in the use of Planning Support 
Systems (PSS). Additionally, countries in the Global South have adopted this approach, and there, 
planning support systems are being increasingly promoted to enhance urban planning. However, 
their adoption remains limited. Prior studies have shown that PSS can enhance planning practice, 
most research has focused on technical development and system design, while leaving a gap in 
understanding how users' roles, planning, and policy processes shape the adoption of PSS, and how 
they can be embedded in the daily tasks. By addressing this gap by examining the adoption of UDM 
in Rwanda, through a qualitative case study approach in four districts.The study employed a qualitative case study approach, collecting data through semi-structured 
interviews, group interviews, document analysis, and participant observation. The research has 
identified that UDM adoption is influenced by the level of user engagement, leadership 
commitment, technical capacity, and alignment with planning processes. However, significant 
challenges still limit UDM adoption, such as limited technical capacity, limited awareness at the 
national and local levels. The study contributes to the PSS research by emphasizing the need to 
align PSS planning with the local planning process and improve users' capacity. The results analysis 
reflects the need for capacity building, supportive policies to improve UDM adoption.These measures are important to embedding PSS in daily planning activities, thereby strengthening 
planning in rapidly urbanising regions. Hence, this thesis establishes the need to consider the users’ 
roles and actions, planning, and policy processes in PSS adoption as a comprehensive solution to 
bridging the gaps in PSS adoption in planning practice. This study was limited by time constraints 
during data collection, high staff turnover, and reliance on a note-taking approach during group

However, there remains a significant gap in how natural and human these chatbots feel. The interaction with the user is limited to text-only interfaces but research shows that the majority of meaning in communication comes from non-verbal cues like facial expressions and body language. When these cues are missing, conversation feels robotic and emotionless. This research aims to improve the user engagement of chatbots by introducing an avatar which responds to the user in real-time with facial expressions and body language based on the emotion of the user. User emotion is detected by analyzing the textual input with an open-source sentiment analysis model. This result is mapped to specific avatar animation to show to the user. 
The evaluation showed that the avatar positively impacted user engagement. Frustration and confusion levels dropped, and participants felt a stronger connection when using the chatbot with the avatar.

The research employed a qualitative approach, interviewing eight seasoned facilitators regarding their experiences of team engagement problems and their strategies for cultivating engagement to identify actionable feedback prompts. Findings largely align with established engagement theory. Specifically, lack of clarity and interpersonal tensions are cited as causes of engagement issues. Additionally, building connection and inclusivity – particularly through iterative group work – and promoting autonomy among team members are identified as key to boosting behavioural, emotional, and cognitive engagement. Furthermore, a comparison of facilitator techniques reveals an intersection between cognitive and emotional engagement. The resulting feedback prompts offer concise, data-driven advice tailored to specific engagement indicators. This work represents a step towards bridging qualitative engagement theory with quantifiable metrics, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of engagement dynamics beyond simply assessing participants’ perceptions, and demonstrating a practical pathway for enhancing team engagement through targeted facilitator support.

Participants perceived both media types as sensationalist, with visual content provoking stronger emotional reactions. However, general views on flight safety and anxiety remained largely unchanged, contrary to prior research suggesting a strong media effect. Bad weather, mechanical issues, and proximity to risk were cited as greater influences on anxiety than media coverage alone.

The aim of this research was to determine whether Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), a statistical data analysis method, can be used to obtain geologically  meaningful relationships between whole rock geochemical analysis and spectra of hydrothermally altered rocks. From these relationships, the aim was to get a better understanding of how spectrally detectable minerals can be used to map hydrothermal alteration. PLSR allows correlating the spectral variables as predictors with geochemical variables as response variables. The data retrieved were taken from a previous study in the Panorama Hydrothermal System, Western Australia. The geochemical variables chosen are the alteration indices (Ishikawa Alteration Index, Chlorite-Carbonate-Pyrite-Index, Silicification Index, and Hashiguchi Index), lithologic discriminators (Nb/Y and log (Zr/TiO2)), and single elements (TiO2). The spectral variables consist of reflectance spectra, measured using all the PIMA bands (601 bands; 1300-2500 nm) and the first derivatives (19 bands; 2184-2220 nm). The PLSR modelling correlated the geochemical variable to the spectral variables. The models derived do not always represent a good model. Several geochemical variables could not be predicted by the spectral variables. The parameters used to select the variables should be more detailed, since the variable used here are influenced by the alteration and the lithology in study area. The variables used, which resulted in good models were interpreted geologically based on these influences.

(ANNs). The study focuses on the theoretical foundations of weight-perturbed forward gradient
descent, examining its biological motivation, mathematical formulation, and convergence properties.
Moreover, a method is introduced for training ANNs with the Heaviside activation function. To
train networks with non-differentiable activation functions, two strategies are explored. The first is
a biologically inspired form of forward gradient descent that leverages random perturbations and
a Taylor expansion to estimate gradients without requiring backpropagation. The second approach
uses a Straight-Through Estimator (STE) that approximates the gradient of the Heaviside function.
We introduce a tunable β parameter that controls the width of the region with a non-zero derivative in
the surrogate derivative. Theoretical analysis confirms the convergence of forward gradient descent
under general assumptions. To examine the role of the parameter β, simulations are conducted using
simulated data generated from trigonometric, polynomial, exponential, and discontinuous functions.
Results suggest that optimal prediction accuracy is typically achieved when β lies in the range 2−5
to 20. Smaller β values limit gradient descent, while larger ones degrade the networks ability to
localize. Performance declines with high-dimensional input, especially for polynomial functions.

The aim of the analysis is inspired by the digital twin development project for efficient energy distribution of Ecofactorij, in which the energy load is expected to be accurately forecasted using AI tools. However, the current pre- diction models are often described as black-box, which means the model cannot project insights into its own decision-making process for the outputs. In order to solve this, several explanation methods have been developed and deployed to address this lack of transparency. Therefore, this analysis aims to reveal the advantages, tendencies, and limitations of each combination of an explanation model and a prediction model for time-series forecasting. In particular, this paper argues for WindowSHAP and TimeSHAP, the two different variants of Shapley Additive Explana- tion(SHAP) by quantitatively scoring them based on their fidelity, stability, and sparsity to exam- ine the characteristics of each coupling in combination with a time-series prediction model with a black-box problem, namely Recurrent Neural Network(RNN), Long Short-term Memory(LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). A human-subject Likert scale survey was used to qualitatively evaluate each explanation method’s performance, which was also evaluated using fidelity, sparsity, and stability metrics. While both approaches show limitations in stability and user interpretability, the results show that TimeSHAP performs slightly better than WindowSHAP across all metrics, especially fidelity.

The aim of the project was to motorize the original device without impeding on the autonomy of the operator by compromising patient safety or full human control. Full MR-Safety is ensured through the use of pneumatic stepper motors, which are fully 3D-printed using PLA. The motorization is focused on axes used for accurate positioning of the biopsy needle, and includes a manual override to satisfy ethical requirements of autonomy and fail-safe behaviour. In an iterative prototyping process and a controlled evaluation, the StepRAM was tested for displacement accuracy, repeatability, and emergency procedures. Results indicate that the system performs close to clinical requirements of accuracy, and Axis 5 consistently meets the sub-millimeter accuracy requirement. While Axis 4 and 6 occasionally exceeded the 1.5mmlimit, their behaviour was stable and traceable back to mechanical backlash. The entire design process was guided through an ethical framework that ensured safety, transparency and usability. The prototype demonstrates that low-cost, MR-safe motorized prostate biopsy devices are feasible and ethical, providing the basis for further research and clinical assessment.",Bachelor Creative Technology (B-CREA),"Thoerl, Oskar",July 2025,English,"No

108158,The Effect of SARS-CoV-2 N-Protein on the Aggregation of α-Synuclein In Vitro and in SH-SY5Y Cells,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108158,"Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. A pathological hallmark of PD is the abnormal aggregation of the α-synuclein (α-syn) protein, ultimately leading to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. With growing evidence linking viral infections to PD, the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic raised the urgency to find potential mechanisms underlying this connection. A study by Semerdzhiev et al. from the Nanobiophysics group demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein), which typically packs viral RNA, can interact with α-syn under simple in vitro salt conditions. This interaction was shown to initiate α-syn aggregation, providing a potential molecular link between SARS-CoV-2 and PD. Building on these findings, this thesis aimed to investigate the effect of N-protein on α-syn aggregation in more physiologically relevant environments. This was done using various biophysical techniques and by performing a colocalization analysis in SH-SY5Y cells.
This thesis demonstrated that N-protein facilitates α-syn aggregation even under complex, physiologically relevant in vitro conditions. This is modulated through a direct interaction and the formation of mixed multimeric complexes, supporting the hypothesis that N-protein may act as a nucleation cofactor in α-syn aggregation. These findings provide a potential molecular mechanism by which viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2 may influence PD pathology.",Master Biomedical Engineering (M-BME),"Fakkert, R.W.M.",August 2025,English,"No.

108157,Together Apart: Exploring Mixed-Presence Social XR in Apple Vision Pro,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108157,"Interest in extended reality (XR) technology is growing, which could soon lead to more situations where headset users interact with non-users. As XR headsets cover the eyes — a key source of cues for turn-taking and conversational flow —
they can disrupt interpersonal interactions. Apple Vision Pro’s pioneering EyeSight feature attempts to mitigate these disruptions by displaying a real-time representation of the user’s eyes, which could help facilitate the exchange of nonverbal information. A between-subjects experimental study with 10 participant dyads was conducted to explore the potential influence of EyeSight on 1) gaps and overlaps
in speech, 2) verbal and nonverbal backchannel cues and 3) proportion of gaze towards a headset user’s face. The presence of EyeSight was an independent variable. While statistical analysis yielded anecdotal evidence for the lack of a meaningful difference for 1) and 2), qualitative reports indicated that EyeSight shows potential
in increasing perceived naturalness of conversation and social presence. Although its appearance elicited mixed reactions, EyeSight seems to have alleviated issues related to the lack of eye visibility experienced in interactions involving regular XR headsets. The analysis of variable 3) indicated a possibility that interlocutors gaze more at headset users’ faces when no eyes are visible. This could either mean increased gaze without EyeSight, due to searching for additional cues, or decreased gaze with EyeSight, because of higher cognitive load. Future work could employ eye tracking technology to separate these effects.",Bachelor Creative Technology (B-CREA),"Szefler, Marianna",July 2025,English,"No

Dominica exemplifies these challenges, having experienced severe impacts from tropical storms and hurricanes in recent decades. This research addresses the need for spatially informed, climate-resilient urban planning by developing and analysing urban growth scenarios for Dominica using a GIS-based modelling approach.
The study assessed how different planning strategies could influence future urban expansion under hazard and climate constraints. Historically built-up area data from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) for 1985–2015 were used to project urban growth to 2050 using linear regression. A land suitability analysis incorporating ten spatial drivers, multiple hazard layers, field work-based participatory mapping and sea level rise projection was procured to allocate urban growth across four future scenarios: Business-as-Usual, Low-exposure to local hazards, Stakeholder perspective and Climate-Resilient Planning.
Findings indicate a strong pattern of urban clustering around existing built-up areas, particularly near Roseau, with topography and hazard exposure significantly limiting outward expansion. Integrating hazard data into the modelling process highlighted spatial trade-offs between development potential and disaster risk. The Climate-Resilient scenario, which excluded high-hazard zones, demonstrated the most balanced spatial outcome but reduced available land for expansion.
A key assumption of this study is that the past built-up growth trend will continue linearly, which may not hold under dynamic policy or demographic changes. Nevertheless, the scenario-based approach offers valuable insights for decision-makers, reinforcing the importance of hazard-informed, anticipatory planning in SIDS. Future work should incorporate recent land-use data and stakeholder input to refine model accuracy and policy relevance.",Master Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (M-GEO-WO),"Manoj, Malavika",July 2025,English,"No

service innovation in digitally mediated, collaborative B2B settings, with a particular emphasis on the 
digital water technology industry. Using the Services-as-Practices (SaP) paradigm, which is based on 
practice theory, the study views service innovation as an emergent, iterative product of changing service 
practices rather than a top-down activity. The study employs an ethnographic research design enriched 
with the Gioia methodology, combining participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and document 
analysis to investigate the real-world dynamics of digital platform use and stakeholder interaction. The 
findings suggest that VCPs, which include understandings, engagements, procedures, and materials, are 
constantly enacted and reconfigured by both human and digital actors, resulting in value creation or 
destruction. These practices promote service innovation through iterative cycles, with co-creation 
promoting stability and steady development while co-destruction, which can often be triggered by failures 
or misalignments, catalyses more urgent and significant modifications. The paper provides a conceptual 
model that depicts how VCP bundles evolve, adapt, and impact innovation through practical, contextual 
changes. It contributes to the literature on service innovation by experimentally establishing the dual 
function of co-creation and co-destruction in practice-based innovation, as well as emphasising the active 
role of digital technology in changing service outcomes. Managerially, it provides actionable insights into

Through a structured experimental methodology guided by the Design Science Research (DSR) and CRoss Industry Standard Process for Machine Learning with Quality assurance (CRISP-ML(Q)) frameworks, we explored critical parameters, including the minimum number of tokens per log sequence, sliding window intervals, and mask ratios. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that shorter sliding windows, despite capturing less context, resulted in slightly higher detection performance of anomalous logs. The model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing normal from abnormal log sequences, where sequences were classified as anomalous if more than 10% of masked tokens were incorrectly predicted. Furthermore, we developed a qualitative assessment with experts that validated the model’s practical effectiveness and underscored its potential for deployment in operational environments.",Master Business Information Technology (M-BIT),"de la Cruz Cabello, Miguel",August 2025,English,"No

108147,WebAI Indicators: An exploration of meaning through topic modeling,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108147,"This study explores how automated innovation classifications are shaped by the language firms use on their websites. It examines what kinds of linguistic signals WebAI uses to assign innovation scores and how these classifications reflect deeper assumptions about the meaning of innovation. Using unsupervised topic modeling, latent themes were extracted from firm website texts and then used as predictors in regression models explaining WebAI’s innovation scores. The analysis included topic distributions, topic interactions, topic concentration, and standard firm-level controls, and the results were interpreted through the lens of signaling theory, organizational communication, digital traces, and science and technology studies. The findings show that WebAI rewards familiar and sector-aligned narratives, particularly those related to digital strategy, sustainability, and technical specialization, while penalizing ambiguous or unconventional content. Among the topics linked to Oslo-defined innovation, those focused on digital strategy or automotive technology were more likely to receive high innovation scores. In contrast, topics based on traditional industrial or technical content were often given lower scores. This shows that WebAI does not treat all types of innovation equally, but tends to favor topics that are easier to recognize or more common in high-profile industries. However, the classifier exhibited strong contextual boundedness, often failing to recognize innovation when it appeared in unfamiliar or interdisciplinary forms. Topic interactions proved more informative than topic concentration alone, suggesting that the classifier relies heavily on recognizable co-occurrence structures learned during training.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Elleithy, Ziad",August 2025,English,"No

While previous work has demonstrated the effectiveness of IMRL in single-agent settings, its application in multi-agent contexts remains largely unexplored. To investigate this, the Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Process (IMGEP) was extended to a multi-agent setup. Four prototypes were implemented, each employing different coordination mechanisms. Experiments were conducted in two grid-based environments: one permitting independent task completion and another requiring collaboration. The results show that agents driven solely by internal motivation fail to coordinate effectively. Adding shared extrinsic rewards also did not yield stable collaboration. However, introducing structured goal alignment strategies—specifically, fixed or competence-based leader-follower mechanisms—enabled agents to support each other and achieve higher task performance. These findings highlight the potential of structured goal selection to facilitate cooperation among decentralized agents and contribute to the development of autonomous systems capable of learning to coordinate without communication or external supervision.",Master Interaction Technology (M-ITECH),"Driel, B.J. van",August 2025,English,"No

of a Hydrogen Energy Storage System (HESS) integrated into
a microgrid representative of a business park. A comprehensive model is developed that includes detailed component-level dynamics, optimal power flow, and energy management strategies. The performance of the microgrid is evaluated under three different scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that the addition of HESS significantly improves system performance. Most notably, the self-consumption rate increases from approximately 80% in the PV-only case to over 99% with HESS integration; effectively
eliminating curtailed solar energy. Additionally, the system’s self-sufficiency improves, and the operational Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) decreases. These improvements are largely driven by the HESS’s ability to act as a form of seasonal storage, capturing excess solar energy during high-generation periods and dispatching it during prolonged shortfalls, such as winter months. While current capital costs for hydrogen systems remain too high for immediate integration, industry projections suggest a significant decline in capital costs by 2030–2035.

While traditional communication has shown limited impact, popular media holds untapped potential to bridge this gap. This study explores how Clarkson's Farm, a popular edutainment series, influences viewers' attitudes and behaviours concerning farming and food. Employing a qualitative research design, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 viewers who had watched at least three seasons, and data were analysed using abductive thematic analysis. Following a theoretical framework grounded in Affective Disposition Theory,
the findings reveal three key mechanisms of influence: (1) Learning-By-Proxy, where Clarkson's genuine vulnerability and the casts’ authentic knowledge foster both emotional and cognitive empathy; (2) Emotional Empathy, which humanizes farmers, leading to increased trust and support for local food systems; and (3) Cognitive Empathy, which enhances awareness of the
food journey, contributing to reduced waste and a greater salience of agriculture, thereby bridging the urban-rural divide. This research highlights the practical implications for media producers and food-industry stakeholders, emphasising the value of authentic, entertaining media content and sustained engagement in fostering robust consumer-producer connections.

108139,Towards Circular Healthcare: A mixed-methods study on the environmental impact of medical disposables in a Dutch hospital,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108139,"Background
Climate change poses the greatest threat to human health in the 21st century. While the Dutch healthcare sector aims to improve people’s health, it contributes to 7% of national greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, the Dutch government introduced the Green Deal for Sustainable Healthcare, aiming for maximal circularity by 2050 and discouraging reliance on disposables. Although the Dutch Federation of Academic Hospitals has assessed the environmental impact of medical disposables in academic settings, the applicability of these findings to regional hospitals remains uncertain.
Methods
This mixed-methods study explores the environmental impact of medical disposables and identifies strategies for reduction at Medisch Spectrum Twente (MST), a Dutch hospital in Enschede. The environmental impact of product categories, expressed in CO₂-equivalents, was estimated through material analysis, considering the production and transport phases. Subsequently, an employee survey identified medical disposables with reduction potential. A focus group using the R-framework for circularity explored mitigation strategies and barriers.
Results
The total environmental impact of medical disposables used at MST is estimated at 556.638 kg CO2-equivalents, with unsterile gloves and absorbent mats contributing to one-third of this total environmental impact. Unsterile gloves, absorbent mats, damp washcloths, and OR covers were identified as high-impact disposables with significant reduction potential. Key strategies include increasing awareness regarding correct usage and adopting reusable alternatives. Identified barriers include perceived loss of autonomy, limited knowledge, logistical challenges, and regulatory constraints. 
Discussion 
This study offers practical and transferable insights for sustainability efforts in healthcare. Limitations include the use of category-level estimates and limited depth in qualitative findings. Implications for practice and policy involve prioritising high-impact categories and promoting collaboration between procurement, sustainability officers, and clinical staff.

Although leadership is receiving more attention in smaller organisations, little is known about how employees perceive leadership and how misalignment between intentions, actions and perceptions impacts their experience.
Based on 21 qualitative interviews across three SMEs from different industries, the findings show that a balanced presence of task, relations, and change-oriented behaviour increases the likelihood of such alignment. In addition, employee satisfaction is primarily shaped by how leadership is perceived in daily practice. Employees perceive leadership based on what they observe and experience, which may differ from what CEOs or managers intend or do. Alignment between intended and actual leadership can enhance perceptions, but only when leadership behaviour is also perceived as meaningful, credible and visible. 
The cross-case analysis highlights the importance of consistent leadership, communication, expectations management, organisational culture, feedback loops and other themes in shaping alignment. These factors are shaped by the broader organisational context and can either support or hinder trust, clarity and engagement. Where alignment is achieved, employees report greater satisfaction.

108137,Applying a Strengths-Based Approach in Multidisciplinary Teams: The Role of Line Managers in Enhancing Team Performance,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108137,"This thesis explores how a strengths-based approach is applied in multidisciplinary teams to enhance team performance. Multidisciplinary teams are composed of professionals from diverse functional backgrounds, and those teams are vital for innovation. However, they often face challenges such as communication issues, unclear role division, and conflicting priorities. A strengths-based approach can help overcome these challenges, because this approach focuses on identifying and utilizing the unique strengths of employees. Managers who implement the strengths-based approach, they recognize these strengths through informal observation and personal conversations, and assign tasks accordingly. This approach leads to increased motivation, greater ownership, improved collaboration, and ultimately, stronger team performance. The central research question is: How do line managers apply a strengths-based approach in multidisciplinary teams to enhance team performance?
A qualitative research design was used in this investigation, involving five semi-structured interviews with line managers of multidisciplinary teams. Participants were selected based on their experience in managing those teams. The interviews were thematically analyzed using a combination of inductive and deductive coding in Atlas.ti. From the data, three main themes emerged, namely: recognizing strengths, utilizing strengths, and the effects on team performance. Managers identified the strengths of their employees mainly through informal observations and having one-on-one conversations with them. Hereby, managers tailored tasks based on the strengths of the employees, created greater autonomy, and built mutual trust. These practices led to increased motivation, greater ownership, improved collaboration, and ultimately, stronger team performance. 
The conclusion is that a strengths-based approach positively impacts team performance, particularly in multidisciplinary teams. Managers can reduce friction and enhance collaboration in multidisciplinary teams, when they leverage the strengths of the individuals in their team. Previous researches show that the strengths-based approach individual well-being and engagement supports, while this study highlights how it helps line managers in multidisciplinary teams. 
These findings are relevant for organizations and HR professionals, because those findings show that focusing on strengths is beneficial for the employee well-being and is also a strategic tool for improving performance. One limitation of this study is that the data only reflects the perspective of line managers. Including team members in future research could offer a more complete understanding of how strengths-based practices are seen and felt within multidisciplinary teams. Additionally, most managers were unfamiliar with the term ""strengths-based approach"" itself, which may have limited the theoretical depth of the findings.",Bachelor Business Administration (B-BK),"Katalanc, M.",August 2025,English,"No.

Water scarcity impacts health, economies, and social stability, even in regions with abundant water due to seasonal variability. Water trading can help address scarcity when well-designed, but has so far been limited to local, single-basin systems. This study explores the potential for connecting separate water markets—physically or virtually—into larger trading networks. A conceptual framework of local water markets was developed using 35 characteristics, covering governance, legal, institutional, and environmental aspects. This framework allows for comparison across diverse markets globally. Eight representative cases were analyzed: Australia, Chile, China, India, Israel, South Africa, Spain, and the USA. Insights from these cases informed a design exercise exploring inter-basin market connections through fictional scenarios based on geographical distance and market environment differences. Three conceptual designs were created: two involving physical water transfers (with and without institutional collaboration) and one using virtual trade via product markets. Expert validation found physical transfer designs more feasible than the virtual model, though all required further development.

capable of withstanding extreme conditions. This thesis investigates the design, implementation, and evaluation of a full widebandgap (WBG) cascode switch optimized for high-voltage space applications. The proposed solution combines a normally-on silicon carbide (SiC) junction field-effect transistor (JFET) with a normally-off gallium nitride (GaN) FET to achieve normally-off operation, high efficiency, and robustness. Through detailed design, simulation, and experimental validation, including simulated double pulse testing (DPT), the performance of the cascode architecture is comprehensively compared against standalone SiC and GaN devices. To demonstrate practical applicability, the cascode switch is integrated into a Switching Latching Current Limiter (SwLCL), an essential protection circuit within satellite power distribution systems. Simulation and prototype measurements confirm the advantages of the proposed solution,
including reduced conduction losses, enhanced voltage blocking
capability, and reliable fault response. The findings highlight the promise of full wide-bandgap cascode structures in advancing the efficiency and reliability of next-generation space-grade power electronics.",Master Electrical Engineering (M-EE),"Voortman, Ruth",August 2025,English,"No

108129,Putting Passengers in Control : A User-Centric System Enhancing the Intermodal Travel Experience through Journey Management and Integrated Data Architecture,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108129,"Intermodal travel is often fragmented and stressful, hampered by information silos and a lack of coordination between transport providers. This thesis answers the question: How can technology consistently enhance the intermodal passenger experience? Following a user-centred design process involving literature review, surveys, and interviews with passengers and experts, a conceptual solution was developed, and its passenger-facing prototype was evaluated through usability testing. Research confirmed that passengers fundamentally desire control, predictability, and reliable information, with different traveller profiles requiring tailored experiences. The proposed solution, developed through an iterative process, is a holistic ecosystem featuring a ""Travel Journey app,"" a multi-layered data architecture, and an operator-side concept for collaboration. Evaluation of the application prototype demonstrated strong conceptual appeal, with users finding the idea innovative and engaging. However, significant usability issues, particularly regarding clarity, were identified. The main conclusion is that technology can best enhance the intermodal experience not through isolated innovations, but by creating a unified, data-driven digital layer that places the passenger at its centre. Achieving this vision is a profound socio-technical puzzle, requiring the fostering of trust, aligned business incentives, and collaborative governance frameworks across the entire travel industry.

108124,Learning from AIDS : applying policy lessons from the UK’s AIDS crisis response to future public health issues,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108124,"At the start of the 1980s, an unknown pathogen was cause for global concern. The virus responsible, HIV, resulted in a major global pandemic that still affects millions of people worldwide. It is often argued that policy responses from resource-rich countries were delayed because of stigmas surrounding those most at risk. The United Kingdom was no exception, with then-Prime Minister Thatcher at the head of a famously strict moralist government. However, compared to other resource-rich countries, the number of HIV and AIDS infections has remained remarkably small. Research has made it clear that in the 21st century, minorities are still disproportionately affected by disease. As governments around the world are developing pandemic response strategies after COVID-19, it is important to analyse what role social stigmas play in this disparity. Thus, this thesis aims to assess how social stigmas influenced the UK government’s response to AIDS in the first decade of viral threat (between 1981 and 1989) and what subsequent policy lessons can be drawn regarding modern government responses to public health issues. A mixed-method case study of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the UK between 1981 and 1989 was used to allow for the data triangulation necessary to validate conclusions based on mostly qualitative data. Overall attitudes and politization of the disease resulting from societal racism, homophobia, and moralism resulted in delays in policy implementations, the dragging out of decision-making processes, or even a total lack of action in the case of the LGBTQ+ community. As the incidence of HIV and AIDS grew, a peculiar combination of bottom-up and top-down governance could be observed. Public priority-setting and crisis definition were spearheaded by top government officials, while policy implementations and developments themselves were organised around community representatives. The most famous example of this is the ‘Don’t Die of Ignorance’ campaign, consisting of a leaflet drop to every household in the country and accompanying television advertisements. The UK’s strategy positively affected the development of scientific knowledge and efforts to elevate the issue’s crisis status, but failed to properly address disproportionate effects on marginalised communities. This resulted in a favourable outcome in the short term as well as in the following decade, but a considerable amount of damage was done in the long term by the government’s failure to address social attitudes.",Master Public Administration (M-PA),"Verschuren, Imke",August 2025,English,"No

However, the combination of these two fields, especially in the context of Data Stream Mining and IoT, is still in its early stages. This research aims to bridge the gaps between the fields of online machine learning and AutoML by designing and developing an Online AutoML platform for streaming data. First, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is conducted to identify the state-of-the-art in Online AutoML and the current gaps in the literature. Then, the architecture of the proposed platform is designed using Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) and the platform is being developed. Finally, the platform's predictive performance and adaptation to concept drift are evaluated against existing ML models already developed by the company where the research is conducted on data from solar installations for predicting solar yield based on solar irradiance. The results show that the platform is able to achieve competitive performance compared to existing ML models, and that the meta-learning approach is able to handle concept drift well in a real-world streaming environment. The results have significant implications for SMEs like El Niño, seeking to adopt ML technologies, despite not having extensive resources for ML development. For future development, it is recommended to implement additional mechanism for alerting the user of the platform about the performance of the model and implement more advanced model snapshotting and restoring mechanisms.

108118,Smarter Industrial Fault Diagnosis with Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models : a Case Study at Mintres BV,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108118,"Efficient fault diagnosis is critical for manufacturers to reduce downtime and ensure operational continuity, especially when dealing with complex, legacy equipment. Mintres BV faces significant challenges due to unclear troubleshooting procedures and a lack of standardized diagnostic knowledge, which often leads to inconsistent repairs and increased dependency on implicit expert knowledge. To address this gap, the study investigates the integration of Knowledge Graphs (KG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) utilising a Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) architecture to streamline fault diagnosis.
Gaps in existing methods were observe through a systematic literature review, especially with regard to the extraction of multilingual knowledge and its actual use in specialised industries like  diamonds and ceramics processing. Building on these discoveries, this thesis uses LLM-based few-shot prompting combined with BAML framework to extract fault entities from unstructured maintenance data and develop an AI-driven chatbot that user can interact in a natural and conversational way when troubleshooting machine faults.
According to evaluation results, this new method extracts structured entities with an accuracy of over 69\%, strong potential despite occasional challenges posed by linguistic ambiguity and annotation differences. Additionally, the chatbot built on GraphRAG efficiently satisfies predetermined functional and non-functional requirements, greatly improving Mintres BV's fault diagnosis capabilities. The study makes two contributions: academically, by being the first to apply LLM-based few-shot prompting combined with BAML framework on Dutch maintenance logs, and practically, by offering a scalable, multilingual AI-based troubleshooting solution designed for specific industrial circumstances.

This study investigated the level of agreement in symptom reporting and its associations with child age and gender. Methods: A total of 84 caregiver-child dyads (children aged 8–18) participated. Both informants independently reported on the child’s PGD symptoms using DSM-5-TR–aligned instruments. Agreement was examined using Bland-Altman plots, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and directionality analyses, with comparisons between internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Associations with child age and gender were assessed using non-parametric tests and regression models. Results: Overall caregiver-child agreement was moderate (ICC = .60), with substantial variation across dyads. Internalizing symptoms showed greater variability but slightly higher ICCs than externalizing symptoms; this difference was not statistically significant. Neither child age nor gender was significantly associated with agreement. Directionality analyses revealed no systematic caregiver over- or underreporting. Conclusions: Caregiver-child agreement on PGD symptoms was modest, with no consistent patterns based on child age or gender.

Traditional approaches of using static sever- ity scores, such as CVSS, rarely reflect real exploitability, as these methods misallocate time and resources for remediating vulnerabilities. This research examined the capabilities of machine learning models, and specifically in- terpretable classifiers, like Decision Trees, to predict the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited. As a starting point, a dataset was identified with CVSS v3.1 metrics, EPSS scores and CISA KEV flags that accounted for technical and empirical signals. Developed and evaluated machine learning models were capable of ranking and identifying high-risk vulnerabilities with basic findings that EPSS percentile and access vector were major predictors. While precision is still problematic due to class imbalance, the explainable models provided transparency, as well as demonstrated good practices for governance obligations. The model outputs were mapped to all desired ele- ments of the NIST SP 800-40 framework, further demonstrating their value in operational situations.

108114,On Self-Modeling Networks in Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems: Toward Artificial Social Cognition,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108114,"A self-modeling neural network refers to an artificial intelligence (AI), or ‘agent,’ with the ability to predict its own internal state. Presupposed that good regulators of a system must be a model of that system, it has been theorized that human brains maintain a proxy model of its attention as well as proxy models of other people’s behavior in social contexts, described by the attention schema theory and theory of mind. Inspired by these theories, this capstone hypothesizes that self-modeling (SM) reduces the internal complexity of a neural network in a reinforcement learning environment. If this hypothesis is supported, SM could serve as a means to make autonomous agents in multi-agent systems more suitable targets for a theory of mind, which could aid their cooperative performance. In order to assess the validity of this hypothesis, the capstone proposes a self-modeling multi-agent proximal policy optimization (SM-MAPPO) architecture and evaluates it against a baseline system on three benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning game environments. Although the
 proposed system did not outperform the baseline in terms of final rewards or convergence speed, it did feature a more stable training process, richer hidden layer entropy, improved regularization, as reflected in a decay of the standard deviation of weight distributions, and
 better interpretability, measured through a principal component analysis. By focusing on the underlying mechanisms by which SM might improve performance, and by replicating
 key effects of SM from prior single-agent studies in a multi-agent setting, this capstone lays the groundwork for future exploration of the practical value of self-modeling.",Bachelor Technology and Liberal Arts & Sciences (B-ATLAS),"Geest, V.J.J. van",July 2025,English,"No.

Even though many studies today exist on self-help apps, and also on MSAs in particular, a perspective that specifically focuses on the manner in which desire is restructured through the use of such apps is still lacking. Therefore, in this thesis I answer the main research question How is the desire of the subject restructured through the MSA? 
My main argument is that throught the use of the MSA, the subject's desire is influences by Technological and Capitalist Others, which consequently leads the subject towards the creation of Techno-Capitalistic fantaties. In this manner, the object of desire remains within reach for the subject within this system, where the subject is ultimately lead astray. Near the end of my thesis I therefore argue for a re-appropriation of the MSA whereby the subject recognises their lack as that which humanises them rather than that from which an escape is needed.

With the tabletop introducing a large number of tokens, the focus is on providing an intuitive, engaging and educational experience. Following a Design Thinking approach, empirical data was gathered through stakeholder interviews, Co-Design sessions, and a usability study using a Wizard of Oz prototype with 20 tokens. This study involved five participants and combined observation, interviews, questionnaires (SUS and UES-SF), and pre/post-test quizzes to assess usability, engagement, and learning. The design achieved a moderate usability score (SUS score of 67) with higher engagement (UES-SF mean score of 4.0/5), though focused attention and perceived usability scored lower. Learning effects were visible in users with less prior knowledge, while overall, interest in the topic remained mainly unchanged. Contrary to prior findings, participants of the usability study were not overwhelmed by the amount of tokens. Instead, confusion caused by a lack of support from the digital interface contributed to reduced usability.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for imputing missing values in tabular data, but face challenges related to context length, computational cost, and potential benchmark contamination. This study explores data reduction techniques to reduce the input size while preserving patterns essential for accurate imputation. Multiple reduction methods were evaluated across real and synthetic datasets under various missingness mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, and MNAR), and data reduction levels. The results show that moderate summarization, particularly using K-medoids, can retain or even enhance imputation accuracy while significantly lowering computational demands. For instance, on the Breast Cancer dataset, LLM imputation with 50% data reduction surpassed the performance of established baseline methods, such as XGBoost and TDM. Furthermore, this study underscores the risk of memorization in LLMs; a comparison of performance on real versus synthetic datasets revealed that traditional imputation methods (e.g., Random Forest, KNN) generalize more reliably.

This thesis evaluates the feasibility of using a 6DOF robotic arm equipped with a passive scoop to automate manual scooping tasks. A parameterized scooping motion—defined by start position, depth, drag distance, and final orientation—was implemented using ROS2 and MoveIt2. Two dispensing methods were tested: complete and incremental dispensing, with the latter relying on a model linking scoop tilt to deposited mass. Experiments were conducted on bell pepper cubes, dried macaroni, and canned sweetcorn, representing a range of material properties. Results showed that high dosing accuracy (±10% of target mass) is achievable for ingredients like dried macaroni, which have low surface friction, low compressibility, and uniform shape. Performance declined with irregularly shaped or compressible ingredients, particularly those with high surface friction. Incremental dispensing offered greater flexibility for varying target masses but was still affected by material properties.

108104,Forecasting the EUR 3M/6M Basis Swap Spread Curve,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108104,"Since the 2008 financial crisis, the EUR 3M/6M basis swap (BS) spread has become increasingly significant and can no longer be considered negligible. This thesis investigates methods to forecast the EUR 3M/6M BS spread curve by comparing traditional econometric (AR model) and machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) approaches across multiple forecasting horizons (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months). The forecasting is based on the Dynamic Nelson-Siegel (DNS) model, using two different estimation approaches. The results showed that the machine learning models did outperform the AR model for some tenors and forecasting horizons based on their cross-validation error scores. However, only a few were shown to be statistically significant. Overall, this thesis introduces the DNS and machine learning models to forecasting the EUR 3M/6M BS spread curve, and has shown that the AR model, despite its simplicity, performs relatively well compared to the machine learning models.",Master Industrial Engineering and Management (M-IEM),"Staarink, Mart",August 2025,English,"No

108103,Validating manual crop annotations using field photo classification for crop reference data generation: A case study in Mozambique,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108103,"Accurate crop reference data is important for agricultural monitoring, but traditional methods are often limited, inconsistent, and costly, especially in smallholder farming systems. This study explores using RGB (Red, Green, Blue) smartphone photos with machine learning and deep learning to classify crops, check manual labels, and create reference data. A computer vision pipeline was built using basic image processing for segmentation, and two models, Random Forest and MobileNetV2, were used for classification. Field photos from three provinces in Mozambique were used to extract colour, texture, shape, and spectral features.
The study used a data preparation strategy with stratified sampling, colour-based segmentation, and feature extraction to reduce class imbalance and handle variation in real-world images. This helped the models learn crop features better, even with intercropping and unstructured imagery. However, Colour Index of Vegetation Extraction (CIVE) and b* channel filtering had trouble isolating crops well, showing the need for better segmentation methods that are still low-cost.
MobileNetV2 performed better than Random Forest in overall and per-class F1-scores. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis showed colour and texture features were most helpful for distinguishing crop types, while shape features contributed less.

108102,Hall effect and field effect measurements on Pb1−xSnxTe nanowires for topological quantum computing,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108102,"We report on the charge mobility and charge density of selective area grown (SAG) Pb1-xSnxTe nanowires, measured at 1.5 K. We extract these parameters by using both the field effect and the Hall effect. Additionally, we perform an extensive analysis of the capacitive coupling between the gate and the nanowire using the finite element method (FEM). We are interested in these nanowires because of their topologically protected surface states, which could serve as building blocks for a robust topological quantum computer. However, to observe these surface states, it is necessary to significantly reduce the amount of carriers present in the bulk. Previous studies have attempted to achieve this in pure SnTe, but these devices were found to be non-depletable due to their highly intrinsic p-type doped bulk. As a result, interest has shifted to Pb1-xSnxTe, where the addition of Pb acts as an extrinsic n-type dopant, which in turn reduces the bulk charge density. Pb1-xSnxTe shows a transition from a trivial insulator to a topological insulator at x ≈ 0.36 at 4K. For pure PbTe, we find electron densities of up to 9.77·1017 cm-3 and mobilities of up to 4050 cm2/V·s. Furthermore, we are able to fully pinch off the carriers in the nanowire for pure PbTe.

Two case studies are analysed: the large-scale De Drie Delfzijlen boezem station and the small Noordeinde- en Geerpolder polder station. For each, 11 design alternatives are evaluated. The results show that energy use during the operation phase is the main environmental impact for larger stations, while materials play a bigger role in smaller ones. Sustainable measures—such as geopolymer concrete, reused materials, and renewable energy—can reduce total environmental impact by up to 50%. Material passports are introduced to track the use and reuse potential of materials throughout the station’s life.

108095,Event Stressfulness and Emotion Regulation in Daily Life - The Role of Psychopathology and Resilience,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108095,"Emotion regulation (ER) has gained increasing attention in psychological research, particularly for its role in mental well-being. Difficulties in ER and the subjective intensity of stressful events contribute to various psychopathological symptoms and mental disorders. Despite growing research, most studies rely on static, trait-level or laboratory assessments, overlooking the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of ER. Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) addresses this gap by capturing real-time data on stress and ER in everyday contexts. This study examined the association between state-level event stressfulness and the momentary balance of putatively adaptive and maladaptive ER strategies, and whether trait-level psychopathology and resilience moderate this relationship. Participants (N = 52; 86.5% female; 73.1% students) took part in an eight-day ESM study, reporting on daily event stress intensity and ER strategies via study smartphones. Trait-level psychopathology and resilience were assessed using validated self-report measures. Higher state event stressfulness was associated with more maladaptive ER use, while trait resilience predicted more adaptive ER. Neither trait psychopathology nor trait resilience moderated the relationship between state event stressfulness and momentary ER balance.

Early detection of high-pressure areas under the foot is critical for prevention and reconstruction. However, current imaging methods often lack the ability to show pressure distribution under weight-bearing (WB) conditions after reconstructions. While MRI provides detailed images of foot structures, standard MRIs are non-weight-bearing and don’t reflect real-life loading.
This thesis explores whether plantar pressure can be simulated using only standard non-WB MRI. A Finite Element Model (FEM) was developed to create a 3D digital foot, adjusted to a standing position using reference MRI. A virtual ground and force simulate body weight, predicting where pressure builds up.
The model was tested on healthy volunteers and compared to actual pressure plate measurements. Results showed good general agreement in pressure locations, though values varied without individual tuning. A key insight was the importance of the offset parameter, where ground force contacts the foot, which greatly affects outcomes.
Despite some limitations, this method shows it’s technically feasible to estimate plantar pressure from standard MRI. With further development, it could support personalized surgical planning and ulcer prevention in diabetic foot care.",Master Technical Medicine (M-TM),"Weusthof, Quinten",July 2025,English,"No

Current scheduling leads to around 253 monthly changeovers, causing scrap, rework, and downtime to rise, yet changeovers by type are not tracked as a KPI for benchmarking.
The research identified the core problem as an ineffective scheduling strategy and developed an MILP model that integrates real constraints to produce robust, shift-based schedules that reduce changeover frequency and lateness costs.
The model was tested against Earliest Due Date (EDD), Shortest Setup Time (SST), and historical schedules.

108089,The rheological evaluation of Xanthan Gum compositions for embedding 3D bioprinting,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108089,"Every year 1000 of patients are in the waiting list for an organ transplant in the Netherlands alone1.
Other options are researched to reduce the dependence on donors. One of them is tissue engineering. Tissue engineering is the scientific field which aims at fabricating artificial tissue constructs that can mimic
the function of native human tissues and organs2. In addition to meeting the clinical demand for artificial
tissues, the aim is creating models that can be utilized for drug testing and potentially replace clinical
trials on animals for a personalized medicine approach3.
3D Bioprinting is the branch of tissue engineering that attempts to fabricate tissue constructs4by using
computer aided design (CAD). The combination of standardization through the machine aided process
of 3D printing, and the customization potential by tweaking the g-code commands of the 3D printer,
offers a suitable solution for the personalized and massive need of artificial tissues4. While there are a
lot of different techniques, such as inkjet and laser assisted bioprinting, the most popular techniques are
stereolithography (SLA) and extrusion bioprinting4–8. In SLA photocurable inks are polymerized under
UV-light or Visible light, and either contain cells within them, or the resulting constructs are coated with
cells post-print8. While the resolution is quite high since it is based on light patterning, the chemical
composition of the resins as well as the low cell concentration per ml which are possible with this approach,
hinder the fabrication of living tissue analogues6.
In extrusion bioprinting a material is controllably deposited through a nozzle in a pattern in the x-y-z
directions5. The material should be shear thinning, in order to liquify upon shear and recover in the
absence of shear so it could retain its shape, in essence demonstrating a thixotropic behavior9. The
material could be a hydrogel with cells, a material that can be coated with cells post-print or even a
cell-only suspension, which all are within the category of bioinks10. Unfortunately, the bioinks that
mimic well the properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) are either ’too liquid’ to keep their shape
after deposition (low viscosity), or they need workarounds to demonstrate thixotropy. This can be done
by crosslinking them post-deposition11, heating or cooling them rapidly, or using photopolymerization
where the same problems as in SLA techniques emerge6.
Embedded bioprinting has come forward as a solution, where a support bath assists inks that are normally
too ’weak’ to print11–13. The support bath can either be a thixotropic hydrogel, such as xanthan gum
(XG)13, or a granular suspension12. In both cases the printing of weak hydrogel inks and their fidelity is
improved13, 14. However the resolution of these techniques still depends mostly on the nozzle diameter
of the 3D printer, and cell only inks present a range of challenges due to their ’particle in suspension’
nature14. Recent developments have shown that, when properly formulated, cell only inks can create
self-assembling tissues through the mechanism of diffusion packing13.
Diffusion packing occurs when a water based Newtonian fluid particle suspension is deposited within a
hydrogel embedding bath13. However the deposition mechanisms, and consequentially the print resolution, are severely affected by the nozzle architecture and the mechanical properties of the embedding
bath15. Specifically in the case of XG, Salt concentration, liquid phase composition and pH can all affect
it’s mechanical properties. Also during cell culture, pH and salt concentration are altered based on the
cell type and the corresponding medium16, 17.",Bachelor Biomedical Engineering (B-BMT),"Hag, Jesse ten",September 2024,English,"No

Although client demand is relatively stable, staff availability varies due to high absenteeism, structural understaffing, and restricted use of external workers such as ZZPs. The core problem lies in the lack of insight into the effective deployment of internal staff capacity. To address this, a two-stage stochastic optimization model was developed. The model first allocates gross contract hours across departments and then reallocates these based on realized absenteeism, using historical data distributions. The Sample Average Approximation method is applied to solve the model under uncertainty. Model outcomes demonstrate that with 429,000 internal hours, a minimal service level of 87 percent can be achieved, which outperforms the current situation while using fewer total hours. Increasing internal capacity to 455,000 hours further raises service levels to 98 percent. The results show that improving internal flexibility is more impactful than expanding total workforce size.

Early detection of forest disturbances is essential for effective conservation strategies. This study evaluated the performance of the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm for detecting deforestation in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil's Paraíba Valley Region. The research examined how the preprocessing of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series impacts the BFAST algorithm performance and assessed the potential for early deforestation detection. The analysis was conducted across three municipalities; São José dos Campos, Paraibuna, and São Bento do Sapucaí using Landsat imagery from 2001 to 2024, with validation against MapBiomas Brasil deforestation data for reference years 2010, 2018, and 2021.
The preprocessing pipeline included outlier removal using mean ± 2SD threshold, data gap filling through second-degree polynomial interpolation, and smoothing with Savitzky-Golay filtering (window size 5, polynomial order 1). The preprocessing improved BFAST performance, increasing the F1-score from 0.23 to 0.6 and sensitivity from 13% to 73%. Raw EVI data detected only large, abrupt forest disturbances, while pre-processed data enabled identification of both large and small-scale forest changes.
Detection accuracy varied significantly across municipalities and time periods, with F1-scores ranging from 0.33 to 0.71. São José dos Campos demonstrated the highest overall performance (F1-scores: 0.49-0.71), while São Bento do Sapucaí showed moderate and consistent results (F1-scores: 0.50-0.57). Paraibuna exhibited the greatest temporal variation, including the lowest performance in 2018 (F1-score: 0.33) but recovery in subsequent years (F1-score: 0.61-0.66). Across the three municipalities, BFAST detected between 33% and 73% accuracy of deforestation events. These figures include early, on-time, and late detections, showing that while the algorithm generally worked well in detecting forest disturbances. Temporal gap analysis revealed strong early detection capabilities, with 60-92% of true positive detections occurring before the actual deforestation year across municipalities and reference years. Mean temporal gaps ranged from 1 to 2 years before the actual deforestation event across municipalities, indicating consistent early warning potential.
Based on the observed variations in deforestation detection accuracy, the study interprets that BFAST performance is likely influenced by local forest characteristics, pixel heterogeneity, and temporal data quality. The ability to detect deforestation early offers valuable lead time for conservation measures, increasing the chances of preventing widespread forest loss. The research provides a foundation for the development of operational early warning systems that can help protect remaining Atlantic Forest fragments through timely detection of disturbance signals, potentially preventing irreversible forest loss and contributing to biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation efforts.",Master Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (M-GEO-WO),"Thirunavukkarasu, Tharani",June 2025,English,"No.

Based on interviews with key stakeholders such as DNB, NOREA, BDO, and various financial institutions, as well as insights from conferences and existing frameworks, a practical compliance model was developed. The model enables financial institutions to classify IT services based on risk, dependency, and substitutability. A visual dashboard and risk matrix help prioritise critical services, while dynamic collaboration tables define roles and responsibilities between institutions and vendors. This approach ensures that compliance is not only documented but actively embedded in operations.

This thesis describes GaitMate, a lightweight veterinary assistant delivered as a Telegram chatbot that allows dog owners to upload video of their dog's gait for automated analysis. The chatbot uses Vision-Language Models (VLM) to provide feedback on possible problems with locomotion in natural language.
Five open-source VLMs were evaluated in a zero-shot setting and created a rubric for the evaluation.Five open-source VLMs were evaluated in a zero-shot setting and a rubric was created for the evaluation. The evaluation showed that Video-LLaMA3-7B was the most promising; it was subsequently fine-tuned via Low-Rank Adaptation with 29 annotated videos in the style of conversational JSON data. The system architecture includes modular components for video preprocessing, prompt construction, inference, and response delivery.
Fine-tuning has resulted in improved contextual reasoning and a reduction in hallucinations. While there were limited quantitative comparisons, the qualitative results showed increased specificity.

108080,A Dutch Environmental Ethics Analysis of Water Management and Governance in the Zuiderzee Area,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108080,"The effects of climate change on water scarcity and flood crisis have become increasingly 
apparent in recent years. With the introduction of the WFD in 2000, EU member states are 
required to ensure water quality of fresh surface and ground water by 2027. However, 
whether the Netherlands will be able to meet the set goals, is increasingly unlikely. Water 
management and governance strategies thus need adapt to these pressures, and ecological 
factors further need to be considered.
In this thesis, an environmental ethics approach is applied to understand the values that 
drive water management and governance strategies. By explicating the values that underlie 
environmental attitudes and management practices, future choices regarding sustainability 
can be made more consciously. Through the implementation of the common environmental 
paradigms ‘Mastery over nature’, ‘Stewardship of nature’, ‘Partnership with nature’, and 
‘Participation in nature’, as well as the ‘Guardianship over nature’ paradigm identified in 
Dutch society by M. de Groot (2012), I will analyse these values. Through the implementation 
of these paradigms, the tensions between values and their trends over time, are understood.
The unique history of the Dutch water management plays an important role in understanding
the values that are present in water management and governance today, as it shaped 
relationship with the Dutch and their environment. In this thesis, I thus show that the 
tensions that underlie water management challenges of the Zuiderzee area today, are rooted 
in its water management history. Because of the need for intensive water management as a 
preposition for survival, as strong sense of responsibility for the environment has emerged
with the rise of ecological awareness since the end of the twentieth century.
With the paradigm analysis in this thesis, I show that the Guardianship paradigm best
interprets the water management and governance narrative of the Netherlands, as it includes 
a sense of responsibility, as well as a desire to be part of nature, which has been shown to 
be strongly present in Dutch society.",Bachelor Technology and Liberal Arts & Sciences (B-ATLAS),"Boertjens, Terra Aurora",July 2025,English,"No

108075,European strategic autonomy : ambitions in a fragmented order,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108075,"Strategic autonomy has in the past decade quickly grown to be high-up on the EU’s agenda.
While many different definitions exist, this thesis uses one of the primary ones in the EU context,
namely:
“Europe’s strategic autonomy entails the ability to act and cooperate with international and
regional partners wherever possible, while being able to operate autonomously when and
where necessary” (Mogherini, 2016)
At the crossroad where the EU now finds itself, its limits are being severely tested. In an
increasingly volatile world, where the Pax Americana is perhaps coming to or has already
reached its end, it has to take more responsibility for its own security, resilience, independence
and economy. However, unlike the strategically autonomous country that has walked this path
before the EU, the EU has to deal with a fragmented political structure, in which there is room
for differing ambitions and aims. This tension resulted in the following research question:
What degree of strategic autonomy is the European Union pursuing and how could this be
achieved in practice within a fragmented political structure?
This paper studies ten actors in the EU, five heads of government of member states and five EU
actors. Additionally, it conducts a literature analysis to answer how the fragmented political
structure of the EU plays a role in achieving strategic autonomy. For the operationalisation of
strategic autonomy, a scale by Vu et al. has been used, where on the one end of the scale
lies no autonomy, and on the other strategic autonomy. The results show that there is near
unanimity on what degree of autonomy should be pursued, namely strategic autonomy. It
also showed, however, that EU leaders have very different definitions and priorities for strategic
autonomy.
The thematic clusters of strategic autonomy have been studied one-by-one on what the EU is
planning for this policy area and how its fragmented political structure influences this process.
It shows that while certain policy areas are very difficult for the EU given its structure, like
migration, some others seem to not have any extra difficulty when compared to a country
with a centralised government, like population growth and ageing. Three main elements that
make achieving strategic autonomy more difficult because of the EU’s fragmented political
structure were identified:",Master European Studies (M-ES),"Bouwmeester, W.",July 2025,English,"No.

108073,The Relationship Between Cognitive Restructuring and Behavioural Activation Within Smartphone-Based Mental Health Apps and Symptoms of Depression : A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Regression Analysis of RCTs,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108073,"Depression is one of the most common mental disorders worldwide. Although effective treatments exist, many people do not receive help due to structural or attitudinal barriers. Digital interventions, such as smartphone-based mental health apps, can help overcome these barriers and reduce depressive symptoms. Cognitive-behavioural approaches are especially effective, yet specific CBT intervention elements like cognitive restructuring and behavioural activation have not been examined in detail. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between cognitive restructuring and behavioural activation in smartphone-based mental health apps and improvements in depressive symptoms, also considering the moderating role of professional guidance. After screening eligible studies, data from 222 papers were extracted, with 162 studies included in the final analyses. A bivariate mixed-effects regression model analysed the relationship between active intervention elements and depression outcomes. The included studies comprised 358 groups and 723 timepoints, with data from 37685 participants (mean age 33.9, SD = 11.1, 71.1% female). Meta-regression showed that both cognitive restructuring (g = -.30, p < .001) and behavioural activation (g = -.31, p < .001) led to small but significant symptom improvements. The interaction between cognitive restructuring and guidance was not significant (g = .05, p = .60). These findings suggest that cognitive restructuring and behavioural activation in smartphone-based mental health apps can help reduce depressive symptoms, while guidance may not significantly enhance effects of cognitive restructuring. The findings facilitate evidence-based design choices to potentially increase app effectiveness. Future research should experimentally test the effectiveness of cognitive restructuring and behavioural activation, for instance by using ecological momentary assessments to identify change mechanisms in CBT-based apps. Aiming to clarify how guidance affects outcomes, studies should also examine factors like the type, amount, and timing of guidance.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Holtkamp, Insa Katharina",July 2025,English,"No

108072,Analysis of spinal implant loads using an electromagnetic tracking approach in a custom vertebral test setup,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108072,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional spinal deformity diagnosed by a Cobb angle >10°. Symptoms include back pain, reduced quality of life, and respiratory issues in severe cases. Current treatments like bracing and spinal fusion often limit mobility. In response, the double spring reduction (DSR) implant was developed in 2023 by Lemans et al. It corrects AIS during growth using distraction springs to reduce curvature and torsional springs to counter rotation at the apex. As spring tension decreases over time, implant loads were analyzed under various spinal configurations using an Electromagnetic Tracking (EMT) system. The DSR implant was mounted on a phantom spine. Three subjects performed probe palpations in duplicate with a 6-degree-of-freedom EM probe. The spine was tested in a neutral position, and at two Cobb angles (25°, 60°) and two kyphosis angles (55°, 67°). Distraction spring lengths were measured manually and via EMT using MATLAB. High reproducibility was observed (intra-rater ICC = 0.949–0.999, inter-rater ICC = 0.996). EMT error ranged from 0.20–42.60 mm. Severe deformities showed lower distraction forces, while the initial position showed the highest. Small palpation differences led to significant load changes due to spring stiffness.

This study extends the existing research endeavors on drought monitoring in the Great Horn of Africa by developing a drought index called the Great Horn of Africa Drought Index (GHDI), a novel multivariate index based on precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage using a copula-based probabilistic approach, which can reflect agricultural and hydrological droughts. The GHDI exhibited good performance compared to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and was validated with FEWS NET (Famine Early Warning Systems Network) and IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) to validate its applicability. GHDI showed a stronger positive correlation with SPI, at longer timescales (r = 0.78 at 12 months), when SPI can compare long-term drought effects, which GHDI already accounts for by integrating P-ET, SM, and TWS. The temporal and spatial variation of drought in the Greater Horn of Africa during the 2010/2011 and 2020-2023 droughts were assessed, and GHDI results showed it was able to capture onset and peak drought periods and severe drought signals even after SPI showed recovery, accurately reflecting sustained hydrological deficits.

108069,The Influence of pH on the Behavior of Soil Under Repeated Freeze-Thaw Cycles,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108069,"Soils in cold regions are subjected to freezing-thawing cycles (F-T) regularly, causing significant 
changes in their physical and mechanical properties, which lead to structural damage and 
ground subsidence. The influence of F-T cycles on soil behaviour has been studied widely; 
however, the effect of pore water chemistry (particularly pH) under F-T cycles remains 
unexplored. This study will investigate how different pH levels (acidic, neutral, and alkaline) in 
pore water affect soil properties and behaviour under successive F-T cycles, focusing on 
sedimentation behaviour, void ratio, frost heave, ice lenses formation, segregation, and 
consolidation. 
Laboratory experiments on soil samples (50% clay and 50% sand) saturated with different pH 
solutions (acidic, neutral, and alkaline) were conducted. Sedimentation studies showed that 
neutral samples resulted in the highest consolidation and the most compacted structure, 
whereas the alkaline sample showed the lowest consolidation with the most loosely packed 
structure. Acidic sample showed a high flocculation of particles with a moderate sedimented 
layer.
Furthermore, the neutral samples exhibited the highest response to F-T cycles, with high 
flocculation in the void ratio between freezing and thawing, with the highest frost heave during 
freezing and the lowest during thawing, owing to the well-connected pore system that promoted 
water migration and ice lenses formation within the soil matrix. In contrast, alkaline samples 
showed the highest void ratio after F-T cycles, resulting in a poor pore system, limited water 
migration, and the smallest frost heave. Acidic samples showed a moderate behaviour in all 
parameters.
The consolidation test resulted in different behaviour of samples before and after F-T cycle, 
showing the influence of pH levels and F-T cycles on soil microstructure. The neutral sample had 
the highest compressibility before exposure to F-T cycles and the lowest after, due to the highest 
densification behaviour during F-T cycles. While the alkaline showed inverse behaviour, due to 
the lowest densification after F-T cycles. Acidic samples showed a moderate compression 
behaviour before and after F-T cycles. Furthermore, the swelling response of these cycles was
not influenced by the F-T cycles, showing the highest swelling for the alkaline samples, the lowest 
for the neutral samples, while a moderate swelling for the acidic ones.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Almustafa, A.",July 2025,English,"No

Traditional capsule endoscopy is passive and lacks precise navigation capabilities, which can hinder the identification and inspection of problem areas and may lead to false negatives and false positives. To address the existing limitation, a magnetic capsule can be used, which is controlled via a robotic arm equipped with a rotating permanent magnet on its end effector.This study investigates the control of the capsule’s orientation using the RPM. Orientation control is crucial for detailed inspection of problem areas, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of underlying issues. The results of pitch orientation control demonstrate that precise orientation is achievable. The measured capsule angles closely match the theoretical angles. Experimental results demonstrated that while flat surfaces yielded low directional mean absolute error (MAE) at shorter distances (e.g., 1.12° at 80 mm), the error increased sharply with distance—reaching up to 23.94° at 120 mm—indicating reduced reliability for longer-range alignment. In contrast, curved surfaces, particularly those with larger curvature, maintained lower and more stable MAE across all distances. These findings highlight that anatomical curvature not only enhances capsule stability but also plays a critical role in sustaining accurate orientation during extended navigation. Overall, this study indicates that orientation control is possible in magnetic capsule endoscopy, marking a significant advancement in the field.",Bachelor Electrical Engineering (B-EE),"Dawadi, A.",July 2025,English,"No.

In this thesis, the relationship between framing in traditional and social media and affective polarization was examined through a qualitative comparative case study with a longitudinal research design focusing on the fall of Cabinet Balkenende IV (2010) and Rutte IV (2023). To answer the research question, “How has the framing of political events on traditional and social media influenced affective polarization between 2010 and 2023 in the Netherlands?”, a content, sentiment, and framing analysis was conducted on 58 NOS articles and 212 tweets. This study combined Iyengar’s Affective Polarization Theory (2012) and Entman’s framing theory (1993) into a framework linking framing styles to changes in affective polarization. The results show that traditional media maintained neutral sentiment, balanced framing methods, and showed no signs of polarization. Conversely, social media exhibited increasingly negative sentiment, one-sided framing approaches, and a rise in affective polarization. These findings indicate that framing of political events in traditional media does not affect affective polarization, while framing in social media significantly contributes to its increase.","Bachelor Management, Society and Technology (B-MST)","Westerhof, Tessa",June 2025,English,"No

hotbox had an efficiency of 78.2% versus 57.3% for PEM, which including ancillaries dropped 
to 19.0% and 12.4% respectively. Environmentally, the PEM stack and PEM facility produce 
double the CO2 emissions during construction in comparison to the stack and facility of SOE, 
whilst producing 20 times higher emissions than SOE during production. The economic 
analysis shows more favourable results for the PEM facility with an LCOH of 9.96 €/kg versus 
14.23 €/kg of SOE. The price of SOE is largely due to the transportation requirements of 
hydrogen via shipping, whereas the operational cost for this specifically are almost similar to
the entire operational costs of the PEM facility. The overall results show that the SOE facility
is technically and environmentally more promising but is compromised by its logistical 
requirements. The PEM facility is currently the best solution to start with the hydrogen 
transition in the Netherlands due to its technical readiness and lower financial barrier. It is 
recommended to search for potential locations in the Netherlands and countries within 
pipeline reach to the Netherlands and combining SOE with existing industrial processes so it 
could be used without compromising its higher technical potential.",Master Sustainable Energy Technology (M-SET),"Kattevilder, M.",August 2025,English,"No.

108057,Enhancing Well-Being in Students : A Systematic Review of Well-Being Interventions in Academic Contexts,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108057,"Student well-being has received growing attention in recent years due to enhanced psychological distress and emotional challenges among students aged 18 to 25 years. Despite the development of numerous well-being interventions within academic contexts, the evidence base regarding their effectiveness remains inconsistent. This systematic review aimed to synthesize findings from studies examining the effectiveness of well-being interventions specifically designed to enhance student well-being in academic contexts. 
Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria and were categorized into three intervention types: positive psychological interventions (PPIs), mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), and other interventions. Most studies reported significant within-group improvements in well-being outcomes, particularly for PPIs and MBIs. Reported within-group effect sizes ranged from moderate to large. Most frequently targeted outcome measures of well-being were psychological and subjective well-being.
It was found that well-being interventions, particularly PPIs and MBIs, can improve various domains of student well-being. However, inconsistencies in the conceptualization and measurement of well-being, a lack of randomized controlled trails, and the overall low to moderate quality of included studies limit the strengths and generalizability of these findings. Despite these limitations, embedding well-being interventions into academic contexts appears a promising strategy to enhance students’ well-being and address emerging mental health needs.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Bekhuis, Geeke",July 2025,English,"No

The goal of this project was to answer the question: How can the design of a flexible and user-friendly housing for an aquatic sensor best meet the measurement needs of researchers in aquatic biodiversity monitoring focusing on offshore wind turbine parks?
Experts in marine biodiversity and offshore wind parks were interviewed. An iterative design process was used, and a physical prototype was realized. 
Testing the physical prototype was not possible due to complications. Experts provided mostly positive feedback. The main source of concern was the installation procedure's lack of planning. Other issues included the danger of collision with ships, acoustic interference, and the risk of marine growth. They identified several key advantages, including the design's aesthetic appeal, scalability potential, affordability, simplicity, and use of pre-existing infrastructure. Additionally, the concept scored well on the three key criteria: Practicality, Usability and Ease of Use.Concluding that this project addressed the challenges of scalability, affordability and simplicity. Making it stand out. Although the physical prototype needs work and did not realize its full potential, the research question can be answered by prioritizing scalability, ease of installation, and robust integration with natural marine elements like seaweed, the sensor housing can support reliable, non-intrusive data collection, addressing researchers’ needs for practical, useful, and user-friendly tools in offshore wind turbine environments.",Bachelor Creative Technology (B-CREA),"Meijden, G.J. van der",July 2025,English,"No.

108053,Visualising Stakeholder Perspectives on Microgrid Interoperability : An interactive approach to communicating strategies in microgrid interoperability,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108053,"In 2024, around 685 million people worldwide live without access to electricity. Decentralised energy systems (DESs) offer a sustainable solution for energy access in remote areas. A key component of DESs is microgrids, which support the scalability and integration of renewable energy sources. A crucial technical feature of microgrids is interoperability, which is the ability of systems to exchange and utilise information. However, interoperability implementation remains incomplete, as it requires collaboration between diverse stakeholders, each with different priorities and perspectives on microgrid interoperability. Limited communication can lead to conflicts of interest and resistance towards innovative energy access solutions. To address these challenges and ensure the successful growth of energy access, stakeholders should gain a better understanding of each other's perspectives to support more informed decision-making. 
The goal of this project was to develop an interactive visual communication tool that represents and compares stakeholder perspectives on microgrid interoperability strategies for energy access. The tool aims to enhance understanding of these diverse perspectives and support more informed decision-making, balancing accuracy, simplicity and engagement while staying true to collected stakeholder data. 
	The project used existing data from an Indonesian case study, where stakeholders' perspectives were identified using Q-methodology. The design process followed an adapted version of the Creative Technology design method, combining ideation, rapid prototyping in specification and realisation and finally evaluation of the final visualisation tool. The final tool is an interactive infographic with a comparison chart. The design was created in Figma and realised as a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The tool allows users to explore and compare different stakeholder perspectives by selecting statement topics to explore strategies in microgrid interoperability. Additionally, they can select which perspectives they want to compare using a radar chart. 
To evaluate the tool, an online survey with experts in energy access and microgrid interoperability was conducted. The results showed that the visualisation is aesthetic and functional and that it effectively compares stakeholder perspectives. Additionally, some areas of improvement were defined, including the intuitiveness of perspective icons and the design of the instructions page.
Overall, the project demonstrated that interactive visual communication tools can help clarify complex stakeholder perspectives. With further refinements, the tool can become a valuable resource for supporting stakeholder understanding and collaboration, hopefully aiding in further development of interoperable microgrids and sustainable energy access.",Bachelor Creative Technology (B-CREA),"Bobić, Nadja",July 2025,English,"No

Noted should be that policies are changing rapidly due to a shifting population structure and changes in the labour market and the design of this research is introduced 
Chapter 2, the literature review, starts with a description of the majority of the patients and describes the organisation of hospital care on Policy level and interpersonal level as well as the role and background of doctors. Within the hospital setting, the patient visits his specialist and hopes for an approachable doctor who is nice, listens, is understandable and can give a positive outcome on his request for help. In this encounter, Shared Decision Making should take place to reach the best possible outcome for the patient. SDM is influenced by enculturation of the doctor during his training and possibly by epistemic injustice when he is not aware of the implications of the knowledge gap and certainly by his communication skills. Also the patient’s culture and attributes impact the outcome even if they passively join the consultation. The mechanics and the requirements of a good SDM conversation are explained as well as the myths, barriers and facilitators. Moreover, four models of SDM, each with their own credentials are discussed as well as a model of communication. Further on, the education of doctors and the role of self-reflection therein is explored.This chapter ends with the Research Question. 
Chapter 3 shortly describes the method of Educational Design Research. 
Chapter 4 writes about the analysis of doctors’ self-reported consultation behaviour, measured by a questionnaire and the development and execution thereof.

The design process aimed at accommodating a wide range of users. Research has shown
that using low effort control, motivating stimuli, and autonomy can guide the successful
design of an inclusive technology. This information, in combination with a PACA analysis
done in a disability care facility, resulted in the first prototype: a pillow-like object that
users could touch or tap, resulting in haptic feedback combined with a swinging motion of
the hammock system for a predefined duration, was made.
Using engagement, perceived safety, and general usage as metrics, this study served as
a proof-of-concept, showing the first results on the usability of the system. A combination
of qualitative interviews with disability care experts (N = 6) and a mixed-methods conditional test with proxy users (N = 10) showed positive outcomes for both engagement and
perceived safety. Autonomy, relaxation, and low-effort control supported the engagement
of the users. Initial supervision will be needed when using the system in day centres, but
over time, it could be used independently.
The potential of the system should be further supported by an iterative process of improving the system. In further studies, the system should be evaluated on the effects on
disabled individuals and caregivers in terms of pleasure, safety, and workload.

108048,LogFormer : Log Event Transformer for Anomalous Event Log Estimator,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108048,"In the era of complex, distributed computing systems, predicting system failures from log data has become a critical but underexplored area in system reliability and maintenance. This study introduces LogFormer, a novel transformer-based architecture designed for log-event prediction and anomaly detection in large-scale system logs. The core contribution of LogFormer is a semantic embedding bias mechanism that enriches attention computations with a learnable global bias, derived from the projection of token embeddings and scaled dynamically. This design helps the model better capture long-range semantic patterns and contextual relevance in noisy, irregular, and sparse log data. In addition, LogFormer integrates learnable positional encodings and Focal Loss to address temporal irregularities and class imbalance, respectively. Together, these innovations tackle the key challenges of structural diversity and rare-event sparsity in system logs. We evaluate LogFormer on three heterogeneous real-world datasets (HDFS, Cray XC40, and Windows 7 system logs), encompassing distributed systems, high-performance computing, and operating systems. Extensive ablation studies and comparative analyses against LSTM, RNN, and the original Time Machine model show that LogFormer consistently outperforms baselines across metrics including accuracy, BLEU score, top-5 accuracy, and particularly in rare event detection. Notably, LogFormer achieves a relative error reduction of up to 85.87\% in rare event accuracy on the Windows dataset and improves BLEU sequence coherence by 72.3\% over the baseline. Despite its increased computational overhead, especially from semantic bias incorporation, LogFormer delivers significant performance gains in syntactic and semantic sequence modeling. The model's strengths in generalization, interpretability, and handling of minority class events make it a promising candidate for production-grade anomaly detection systems. However, the current design lacks support for unseen log event IDs and requires retraining in dynamic environments, which future work aims to address via zero-shot learning and continual adaptation strategies.

To speed up the computational costs of these systems, model order reduction (MOR) methods are used. Commonly, classical MOR methods such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) are used. However, in the process of reducing the model with POD, the underlying properties of the Hamiltonian system, such as energy preservation, are broken. With some modifications to the POD, new methods have been developed that preserve the structure of the Hamiltonian system during the reduction. In this thesis, we explore the following structure-preserving model reduction methods: cotangent lift, structure-preserving POD (SP-POD) adapted from, and variationally consistent Hamiltonian reduction. Originally, the SP- POD was used for port-Hamiltonian systems, but we adopted this technique for linear Hamiltonian systems. We find that at a low dimension, SP-POD has a very high state error, but performs better at higher dimensions. The cotangent lift has the best accuracy of the methods we tested.",Bachelor Applied Mathematics (B-AM),"Buijnink, Jasper",July 2025,English,"No

108044,Contrastive Prompt Tuning: Towards Energy-Efficient Code Generation,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108044,"Large language models (LLMs) have become an important tool in modern software development due to their ability to help with code-related tasks such as code generation. Although LLMs were found to be capable of generating functionally correct code, they also tend to produce less energy-efficient code in comparison to human-written solutions. As these inefficiencies lead to higher computational overhead, they are in direct conflict with Green Software Development (GSD) efforts. This area is concerned with green coding practices and is committed to reducing the energy consumption of code. To support these efforts, this study aims to investigate whether and how LLMs can be optimized to promote the generation of energy-efficient code. To this end, a new approach called Contrastive Prompt Tuning (CPT) is used. CPT combines Contrastive Learning techniques, which help the model to distinguish between efficient and inefficient code, and Prompt Tuning, a Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) approach that requires only a fraction of the cost of traditional fine tuning. This study evaluates CPT on Python, Java and C++ coding problems across three different models to provide a comprehensive evaluation.

This research investigates UGBS in Twekkelerveld, Enschede, comparing objective spatial provision with children's subjective experiences to inform child-responsive co-design.
Using a mixed-methods approach including GIS analysis, policy review, and surveys with 38 children, the study found a major disconnect. While objective UGBS provision generally meets broad standards, policies lack specific considerations for migrant children. Critically, children value functional spaces like schoolyards over passive green areas, prioritising ""interesting activities"" above all else. They desire hyper-local (<100m) functional spaces but will travel far (>2km) for high-quality amenities like lakes, which are scarce locally. Migrant children face additional non-physical barriers like language and fragmented social networks.

Current practices, which rely primarily on paper-based oral fluid intake charts, are prone to inaccuracies due to inconsistent recording, human error, and incomplete data capture. High workloads and limited digital integration exacerbate these issues. To overcome these limitations, this study developed a user-centred, sensor-based solution: the Monitor Mug. This smart container integrates a load cell and an inertial measurement unit to automatically and accurately measure the volume of fluid intake. It interfaces with a digital platform that provides real-time data to healthcare professionals, eliminating the need for additional input during patient care routines. User research, including interviews with six healthcare professionals and observations at CGT, informed the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, while iterative prototyping and user testing guided its refinement. The system was tested with five healthcare professionals, each performing five tasks related to oral fluid intake monitoring with the Monitor Mug. Evaluation results, including a 98.28% volume estimation accuracy and a System Usability Scale score of 95.5, indicate that the Monitor Mug offers a practical, accurate, and minimally intrusive alternative to the error-prone oral fluid intake chart.

108037,The Impact of Automating Procurement Tasks on the Resilience of Supply Chains,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108037,"Industry 4.0 and task automation can have a huge influence on supply chain performance. While automation is widely recognized for its profound effects on operational efficiency, its specific implications on various areas of supply chain resilience are not explored. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining how the automation of procurement tasks influences the defining elements of supply chain resilience. Using A mixed-methods approach is used that combines literature review with primary data collected through a survey administered to procurement professionals. The literature review establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework by defining procurement, detailing task automation, and the concept of supply chain resilience. This framework then informs the formulation of specific hypotheses that guide the subsequent data analysis. The research categorizes procurement tasks into four key disciplines: Risk Management, Strategic Sourcing, Supplier Relationship Management, and Operational Efficiency. For each of these disciplines, distinct hypotheses are tested to ascertain which supply chain resilience factors are most significantly affected by automation. The findings suggest that automating tasks within Risk Management and Strategic Sourcing can positively enhance supply chain resilience. The impact on Supplier Relationship Management and Operational Efficiency is weaker but still suggests that benefits can be gained from automation but also indicating areas that warrant further in-depth investigation.

108036,Selection framework of environmental assessment methods for medical devices,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108036,"Reducing the environmental impact of medical devices begins with assessment of the impact. While Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the golden standard, it is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to use. Alternative methods, like calculators and checklists, are hypothesized to contradict these factors, but may lack accuracy and reproducibility. This study assessed that hypothesis in three steps. First, 26 assessment methods were identified through a systematic literature review and classified using an adapted ecodesign framework. Second, a questionnaire was developed to guide medical device companies select a method suited to their product and goals. Third, a case study at Stepp Footcare compared a calculator (Footprint Calc, The Footprinter) and a checklist (Maturity Grid Assessment Tool, Moultrie et al.) to a benchmark LCA (GaBi, Sphera) in assessing the environmental impact of producing custom insoles via milling and 3D printing. Results showed the calculator aligned closely with the LCA’s climate change results and identified similar high-impact life cycle stages. The checklist showed greater differences and less accuracy, but it was the fastest and easiest to use. The LCA required the most time and expertise.

108035,Exploring and Understanding the Role of Educational Boredom in Dutch Secondary Vocational Education,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108035,"Introduction: Educational boredom is a complex and underexplored issue in secondary vocational education. Despite their societal importance, these students are often overlooked in research. This study addresses that gap by exploring how Dutch secondary vocational students experience, interpret, and cope with boredom. Using Self-Determination Theory, the study emphasises boredom as a meaningful signal of unmet psychological needs within the learning environment.
Method: This study employed a qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews with 19 students from various programmes and levels within secondary vocational education. 
Results: The interviews revealed that educational boredom is widespread and is linked to poor communication, irrelevant content, limited autonomy, and unmet psychological needs. Students interpret boredom differently, ranging from passive frustration to constructive self-reflection, and adopt various coping mechanisms and strategies. While many students disengage, others actively seek meaning or challenge. 
Conclusion: This study shows that educational boredom in secondary vocational education is a multifaceted, subjective phenomenon resulting from complex interactions among personal, contextual, and systemic factors. A lack of connection to the individual student plays a central role. Rather than eliminating boredom, education should seek to understand it as a meaningful signal of misalignment between student needs and the learning environment.",Master Communication Science (M-COM),"Fokkens, L.J.",July 2025,English,"No

108034,Mediating AI in the Workplace: Understanding Professional Decision-Making in AI Adoption,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108034,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more common in professional settings. While organizations invest in AI tools to improve efficiency, it remains unclear how professionals actually use these tools in daily work. This study investigates how professionals mediate between AI systems and their work environment. The research is based on eight semi-structured interviews with consultants and support staff at a large international organization. Using the Gioia method, four key dimensions of mediation were identified: professional discretion, institutional framing, professional identity, and organizational enablement. The findings show that AI is not simply accepted or rejected. Instead, use depends on context. Professionals evaluate AI output based on task type, responsibility, and client expectations. In low-risk or internal tasks, AI is used more often. In complex or client-facing work, AI is approached with caution. Professionals use AI tools critically, often adjusting or ignoring suggestions when needed. This process is shaped not only by the tool itself, but also by internal policies, onboarding, and reputational concerns. The study contributes to existing literature by showing that AI adoption is not a binary process, but an ongoing negotiation. Mediation is not optional; it is a necessary part of making AI work in practice. The results suggest that organizations must provide clear guidance, support critical use, and recognise AI-related skills as part of professional work. These findings offer a more grounded understanding of AI use and can support more realistic AI strategies in complex work environments.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Keizers, B.J.F.",July 2025,English,"No

108033,Evaluating the Role of Dutch Water Boards in Promoting Efficient Freshwater Use: Legal Authority and policies,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108033,"This research investigates how Dutch water boards (waterschappen), specifically those located in the eastern regions of the Netherlands, contribute to promoting efficient freshwater use. The research focuses on the policies implemented by water boards, the legal and institutional frameworks within which they operate, and the challenges they face in achieving efficiency.
The findings reveal policies typically aim to increase system resilience and retain water in the landscape, rather than explicitly reduce abstraction or promote end-use efficiency. Legal frameworks like the Water Boards Act and the Environment and Planning Act provide water boards with authority over regional waters and small-scale groundwater abstractions. However, their influence over large abstractions, spatial planning, and drinking water provisioning remains limited. This fragmentation, alongside political sensitivities and a traditionally execution-focused administrative culture, constrains their capacity to implement more ambitious efficiency measures.
Nonetheless, the research identifies opportunities for enhancing the water boards’ role through more integrated governance, inclusion of efficiency conditions in permits, and greater alignment between legal authority and environmental objectives. These insights contribute to ongoing debates about adaptive water governance in the face of climate change and highlight the strategic role that water boards can play in fostering long-term water security.",Master Public Administration (M-PA),"Haak, Jasper",January 2025,English,"No

108032,From Waste to Value : Implementing Optimised Manure Management Systems in Industrial Pig Farms,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108032,"Industrial pig farms produce enormous quantities of manure, bringing different environmental
challenges, including greenhouse gas emissions, odour pollution, and nutrient runoff. Although a
wide range of solutions is available and the technology is present, many of them are
underutilised due to engineering, financial, and regulatory constraints, which question their
feasibility in the Netherlands. As a result, many farmers treat manure as a waste material rather
than a valuable product. This thesis addresses this issue with a comparative analysis of the most
commonly used manure management systems in industrial pig farms, focusing on the three main
stages of the manure process: collection, storage, and treatment. The analysis is bounded by the
proposed “Three E’s” – engineering, environmental, and economic – to assess the performance
of each solution in simple but clear terms. The central focus of the research is the identification
of implementation bottlenecks encountered in different waste-to-energy and waste-to-value
solutions and exploring ways in which manure can become a valuable end product by optimising
various stages of the manure management process. Despite the proven benefits in multiple
studies, the adoption rate and biogas production are still relatively low in the Netherlands.
Moreover, certain storage and collection systems lack the capability of delivering a good end
product to these plants or are too inconvenient for the farmers to use, resulting in most of them
opting for simpler but less environmentally sustainable solutions. This thesis aims to answer
these specific questions through interviews with different stakeholders and a farm-based
comparison, uncovering the hidden implementation barriers in managing and constructing these
systems. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to uncover practical pathways for transforming
manure from an environmental liability to a valuable product, contributing to future-proof
practices in agriculture through three different proposed solutions: centralised biogas plants, deep
pit retrofit with hydroisolation & upgraded collection system, and lastly, compartmentalised
storage & separation in lagoons & silos. These solutions were presented to a panel organised by
the external supervisor, composed of industry experts and rated based on their viability in the
Netherlands. The advantages and drawbacks were discussed in depth to assess each proposed
solution based on different criteria. Finally, the findings were considered to be conclusive,
contributing to potential future improvements in sustainable practices in pig farms.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Lucutar, T.F.",July 2025,English,"No.

108031,Optimizing User Experience of Decentralized Applications for Web2 and Web3 Users : Case Anonymous Decentralized Social Platform,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108031,"The rapid evolution of decentralized applications (dApps) in the Web3 ecosystem poses unique challenges for user experience (UX), especially as Web2 users meet unfamiliar blockchain technologies. This paper investigates how the UX of dApps may be enhanced to cater to both Web2 and Web3 users, using Unirep Social Taiwan, a decentralized social network, as a case study. The main research issue is: How can the user experience of decentralized applications be adjusted to accommodate both Web2 and Web3 users? The study investigates user demands and obstacles in the transition to decentralized platforms, drawing on ideas such as the Technology Acceptance Model, Nielsen's usability heuristics, and ISO 9241-11 usability standards. The paper situates these issues within the larger framework of blockchain's transparency, data sovereignty, and user control principles.
Employing a mixed-methods approach, the research included two iterative rounds of usability testing involving seven participants per round. Quantitative metrics such as task
success rates, completion times, and System Usability Scale (SUS) scores were analyzed alongside qualitative data gathered from think-aloud protocols and interviews. Iterative testing
allowed for the evaluation of UX optimizations and their impact on user satisfaction. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in usability metrics between rounds. Task success rates increased from an average of 98% in Round 1 to 100% in Round 2, while SUS scores improved from an average of 62.14 to 70.36, reflecting enhanced user satisfaction.
Qualitative insights revealed that simplified onboarding processes and transparent feedback mechanisms reduced cognitive load for Web2 users, while Web3 users appreciated
improvements in transaction transparency and system control.
The findings highlight the importance of bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3 user expectations through progressive onboarding, real-time feedback, and design strategies that
balance usability with decentralization principles. These insights contribute to the growing field of UX research in Web3 by providing actionable recommendations for dApp developers.

Traditional investment evaluations often yield negative financial outcomes, making it difficult to justify necessary projects. Simultaneously, there is no standardized method to assess the social impact of investments at the project level—despite social impact being central to the mission of housing corporations.
This thesis investigates how social impact can be evaluated more effectively and proposes a structured approach using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Through a literature review, interviews, and a survey of the sector, five key social themes were identified: affordability, availability, quality, livability, and sustainability.
Findings show that current social impact evaluations are often qualitative and inconsistent. Interviewees expressed the need for a method that is simple, flexible, and combines qualitative and quantitative data. MCDA/AHP methods meet these requirements by allowing investment alternatives to be scored and weighted across standardized indicators. Over 75% of survey respondents deemed such a method applicable.
The thesis concludes that MCDA/AHP provides a promising basis for more balanced investment decisions and recommends further refinement and testing in practice, with attention to project type, context, and the integration of qualitative insights.",Master Industrial Engineering and Management (M-IEM),"Langevoort, E.S",August 2025,English,"No

The safety of electrically-powered aircraft is of critical importance. Aircraft, unlike cars cannot just stop in case of an emergency, therefore information about the state of safety of the batteries can prevent accidents. The procedure consists of four steps. 1) Identify system abuses that deteriorate safety and lead to failures. 2) Identify failure propagation paths. 3) Identify the relative impact of each abuse. 4) Create a series of functions that predict the safety of the battery. Starting from a system hierarchy and design choices, failure modes and propagation paths are identified. An analytic network process is conducted to determine the most influential abuses on the safety of batteries. A probability density function describing safe and unsafe thresholds is created for each abuse. The state of safety is the product of all abuses. 
The procedure is tested against randomly selected data points of known battery abuse and failure histories. For the given test data set, a single point could not be correctly identified at the very onset of an abusive condition. Nonetheless, the procedure is capable of predicting the state of safety in most cases.",Bachelor Electrical Engineering (B-EE),"Dalitz, Jonas",July 2025,English,"No

The aim of this research is to explore the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in machine scheduling and to compare its performance with Limis Planner and the Earliest Due Date dispatching rule. The machine scheduling problem that is central to this research is the (Flexible) Job Shop scheduling Problem ((F)JSP). The AI scheduling approach that is applied to solve this problem is adapted from a cutting-edge end-to-end policy-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model from literature to include a minimum total weighted tardiness objective and manual job priorities. Besides, an alternative model is developed that incorporates a flexible machine availability extension by introducing new scheduling logic. The comparison between all scheduling approaches shows that the DRL approach is able to match the tardiness performance of the rule-based approaches in some of the less due date tight instances, although it is not as good in prioritising higher priority jobs. In cases of high due date tightness, the DRL approaches are making different trade-offs between focusing on minimising tardiness and prioritising higher priority jobs. The most suitable scheduling approach therefore depends on the preference of the end user of the approach.",Master Industrial Engineering and Management (M-IEM),"Slutter, C.P.E.",January 2025,English,"No

108021,Bringing Food Waste into the Picture,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108021,"About one-third of the world’s food supplies are lost each year, equating to an astonishing
1.3 billion tons of consumable food. If the ""primary product equivalents"" are included,
the loss is 1.6 billion tons per year. All of this is damaging food security, natural resource
sustainability, and the environment, and fueling the imperative call for loss and waste
reduction in food production, distribution, and consumption.
The main problem that this work addresses is the significant amount of food wasted in
households, which not only causes economic harm but also greatly contributes to environmental damage, such as diminishing resources and greenhouse gas emissions. Even
though food waste occurs at every stage of the food chain, from production to disposal,
this research focuses on household food waste, as it represents the largest share of total food waste. Global studies indicate that food waste is predominantly generated at
the consumer level, with households contributing approximately 61% of total food waste,
followed by food service (26%) and retail sectors (13%) (UNEP, 2021)22According to
Eurostat (2024)3, the European Union generated approximately 59.2 million tonnes of
food waste in 2021, averaging 132 kilograms per person. Households were responsible for
54% of this waste, equating to 72 kilograms per inhabitant. Specifically in the Netherlands,
food waste remains a significant concern, with Dutch consumers discarding approximately
33.4 kilograms of food per person annually, equating to just under 9% of all purchased

This leads to the research question: “How can a puzzle within an escape room be designed and evaluated to train CRM skills, support teamwork in acute care, and be perceived as useful, usable, and maintainable by healthcare professionals?” At first a literature review and background research was conducted in order to understand essential design elements which help improve CRM skills. With some key design factors being an enforcement of communication through varying locations, applying time pressure and encouraging free leadership. A puzzle was designed through ideation, stakeholder analysis, and requirement determination, which digitally displays a maze in which the players have to find a code to escape. The players are divided up into 4 different puzzle components each placed in different areas within the room
The maze uses wireless communication through a server-client model and uses three tablets, a joystick and a custom pin input to allow players to view and navigate through the maze. Components were chosen and designed for the final product to be cost-effective, portable and easy to use. The product was evaluated through a user test, consisting of two maze run throughs, utilising observations, performance data and participants feedback. Results showed overall improvement in clear communication, although the statistical significance was not given, likely due to the low sample size. While improvements could be traced back to groups getting more familiar with the puzzle, a learning effect of CRM skills can still be argued.

Evidence From Ethnographic Study in Vietnam,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108016,"Purpose: This study aims to provide a more contextualized understanding of IT implementation in small family businesses. As technology continues to evolve rapidly, small family businesses face unique challenges in implementing IT systems, that are often overlooked in research that focuses primarily on large organizations.
Method: The research examined Hai Dang Light Ltd., a small electronics retailer in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, to explore the IT implementation process within the family business context. Using a qualitative ethnographic approach combined with grounded theory, the study investigated what shapes and challenges the IT implementation process.
Results: The findings reveal that the small family business culture at Hai Dang Light is rooted in trust, family connections, and informal communication within a small group of people. Organizational support is generally perceived as adequate, with some feedback, while individual effort is high but inefficient due to management of the implementation process.
Conclusion: The research concludes that organizational support plays a significant role in shaping how individuals engage with IT implementation. A lack of strategic planning and accountability is identified as a key factor influencing resistance to change, thereby hindering successful IT adoption. This study highlights the importance of aligning strategic planning with organizational culture and individual effort to ensure effective IT implementation in small family businesses.

Everyone wears clothes, whether they have been bought at a large retailer, a boutique, or have been thrifted. (Ultra-)fast fashion retailers offer enormous amounts of options to consumers. This leads to high consumption rates. As a result, overconsumption is turning into a bigger problem every day, from polluting water during production, to generating enormous amounts of textile waste, to exploiting workers in low-income countries. This research therefore aims to design an interactive intervention to activate young consumers aged 17-26 to make more sustainable, ethical, but mostly conscious choices about their fashion consumption. This intervention includes the factors that influence consumption and presents them in an engaging, fun way.
A literature review was conducted to find out the exact factors that influence the consumption of fashion by young adults. Along with this, existing organisations and technical solutions have been explored to start developing an intervention that encourages young consumers who are already interested in the subject at hand to explore their sustainable options and consume consciously. The intervention has been designed using the Creative Technology design process, consisting of an ideation, specification, realization, and evaluation phase. The ideation phase consisted of brainstorming sessions leading to a concept that was chosen based on requirements defined in the background research. Specification included defining the whole interaction and interviewing shop owners about the data they were willing to share and their sustainable practices. During the realization, the specified concept has been made into a fully functional prototype: the Green Fashion Hunt, an interactive tour through Enschede, leading users across 4 fashion stores with a sustainable standpoint. Users can scan a tangible token at every store and read more information about the mission, type of store, environmental, and social impact the store has. The tour has been evaluated during the evaluation phase. The evaluation consisted of two groups of 9 people each, testing the added value of tangible tokens and the overall concept.

Therefore it is important to optimize the staffing levels in these specialized care facilities. In this report we modeled a geriatric care organization which treats two patients, type 1 and type 2, as a multidimensional markov chain. Each patient could be treated in their respective bed type or in a flexible bed. A bed in our setting represented the staff and resources needed to treat one patient. Our model took into account both costs associated with bed blocking and costs associated with unused resources in order to find which bed configuration has the lowest expected costs. We simulated, through the creation of two discrete event simulations, two types of flexible bed usages: when patients in a flexible bed transfer to their respective standard bed as soon as one is available and when patients remain in the same bed for the entire duration of their treatment. Our simulated results showed that having patients transfer from a flexible bed to a standard bed once one is available is associated with lower expected costs.",Bachelor Applied Mathematics (B-AM),"Laar, Eva van",June 2025,English,"No.

108009,Joint drone search operations with risk of elimination,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/108009,"We consider search games that are played between a hider and a searcher where the searcher has access to multiple search agents that search as a team for some number of targets hidden by an adversary among a set of locations. Searching a location poses some level of threat to the searcher and with some known probability, they are eliminated. When all searchers are eliminated before all targets are found, the search ends in a failure. The search team tries to maximize the probability that all targets are found and the hider tries to minimize this probability by their choice of locations. Our research is based on a paper by Lidbetter from 2020 which considers the case for one search agent. We develop a general framework for this type of search game that also encompasses Lidbetter's results and study three types of strategies for the searcher when they have access to two search agents. In the first, all but one search agent remain idle until the active search agent is eliminated. In the second, the search agents split and each search different locations. In the third, the search agents search each location as a group. For the first strategy, we find a Nash equilibrium that is similar to Lidbetter's single agent case and for the second, we show that the value of the game does not improve for the searcher when taking these strategies into account. For the third we show that this strategy never does better than the first and most of the time does worse. We believe that these results regarding the three particular strategies are a significant step in finding a Nash equilibrium for a general search game with chances of elimination.",Bachelor Applied Mathematics (B-AM),"Muntendam, Nick",July 2025,English,"No

ISAC aims for the reuse of signals and hardware for dual functionality, making orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) a promising waveform for both communication and sensing. Under this context, this paper focuses on turning radio network node as an OFDM monostatic MIMO radar, and investigates the possibility for multi-target breathing sensing and differentiating shallow and deep breathing patterns. 
In this work, a complete system model including the transmit signal, multi-antenna array, channel including target motion, and channel estimation at receiver was built. A whole signal processing chain was developed to estimate the angular-range-Doppler information from the estimated channel, considering various influencing factors. These include signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels, observation time, slow time sampling frequency and duration of the coherent processing interval (CPI).

If this is done, clock offsets can cause data from different computers to be wrongly fused based on their timestamps. Clock synchronization minimizes clock offsets between computers. This work evaluates the effect of (a lack of) clock synchronization on the performance of a distributed robotic system using two common use cases, hand-eye calibration (HEC) and touch detection (TD).
For each use case, clock offset requirements were determined by identifying offset-sensitive fusion instances in the data flow and deriving the absolute maximum allowed clock offset. Based on this, the Network Time Protocol (NTP) was selected as clock synchronization technology and implemented using timesyncd and chrony optimized for a local network.
Deliberate clock offsets of 15 ms, 45 ms, 150 ms, and 1 s were applied to each use case to simulate high clock offsets. The effect of these clock offsets on the accuracy of each use case was evaluated.
Based on the HEC and TD evaluations, it was concluded that clock synchronization is required to maintain accuracy under high clock offsets. Master Biomedical Engineering (M-BME)",Master Embedded Systems (M-EMSYS),"Hierck, Jelle",July 2025,English,"No

Due to limited access to professional help, many people rely on coping strategies to manage the symptoms independently. Avoidant coping correlates with increased severity of depression, whereas approach coping is considered the most effective way to deal with the challenges of depression. In search of support, people often turn to online forums like Reddit, where a high prevalence of depression-related posts can be found. However, which coping strategies are most frequently discussed and recommended there has not been a subject of research yet. This study therefore investigated the discussion of avoidant and approach coping across depression-related posts from different subreddits, by applying a text-mining approach. A dataset containing over 35,000 posts from six subreddits was analysed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Approach coping was discussed more frequently across all subreddits, compared to avoidant coping. The frequency of coping strategy discussions varied significantly (p < .001) between subreddits, with r/selfimprovement showing the highest prevalence of approach-oriented posts. The findings of this study underline the feasibility and potential of LDA as a method to evaluate the coping strategies discussed on mental health forums and offer insight into the support available across different subreddits.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Vogtmeier, Lino C.J.",July 2025,English,"No

Unlike traditional pump-based systems, this setup eliminates moving parts, enhancing simplicity, cost-efficiency, and miniaturization. Multiple TV designs were evaluated by measuring flow rates under specific pressure drops, with diodicity used to identify the most effective configuration. The optimal TV was integrated into a VOC system consisting of two reservoirs connected by a VOC and TV channel. A hydraulic-electrical analogy was used to model the system, estimating backflow and wall shear stress (WSS). The results showed the system could produce the necessary pressure and WSS for liver sinusoidal endothelial cell studies. However, significant backflow was calculated, preventing truly unidirectional flow. This limitation renders the system unsuitable for organ-on-chip (OOC) models requiring unidirectional perfusion. To address this, future work should aim to reduce backflow, potentially through enhanced valve geometry or incorporating multiple TV’s to the VOC channel.

light waves instead of traditionally used radio waves. Due to the narrow
laser beams used in FSO, extremely precise pointing is required. Small

is essential. This thesis explores the usage of Kalman filtering to
improve FSO tracking by filtering out common errors caused by
turbulence, mechanical and electrical jitter and signal dropouts. Using 2
simulations in Ansys STK with baseline pointing data, noisy pointing
data and filtered pointing data. The first simulation contains a ground
station tracking a satellite, the second contains one UAV (Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle) tracking another UAV. Results show that Kalman filtering
can significantly reduce the effects of the aforementioned errors in the
first simulation. However, limitations are shown when tracking objects
which suddenly change direction which the filter cannot properly remove

By examining user comment themes and tone during high-interaction periods, this thesis investigates celebrity cancellation discourse dynamics on Reddit and YouTube. It addresses a gap in cancel culture research by focusing on comment dynamics at peak moments and providing in-depth, user-centered analysis. A mixed-methods approach analyzed comments from YouTube and Reddit posts about six USA-based celebrity cancellations. Steps included community detection, trend analysis, and manual coding of top comments per community for tone, stance, and themes. Findings were contextualized against public statements and real-world developments, then compared across cases to identify recurring patterns. Findings reveal comment spikes in response to allegations, public statements, or media coverage. These peaks form cycles of engagement, with discourse evolving from accusatory and emotional to more reflective. Most comments show judgmental, critical, and emotional tones, reacting to allegations and offering moral judgment. This thesis argues that celebrity cancellations are dynamic, emotionally charged discussions shaped by platform dynamics, social media rhythms, moral judgment, and criticism, rather than objective, nuanced discussion of static events. Cancellation discourse sustains ongoing debates about accountability and public identity in participatory media.",Bachelor Communication Science (B-COM),"Groenewoud, Jessica T.J",June 2025,English,"No

behavioural video coding and a post-task survey, which examined mutual gaze, shared focus, and
response to gesturing. Although observed group differences were modest and not strongly supported
by statistical evidence, participants in the ON/OFF condition demonstrated higher mutual gaze rates,
suggesting compensatory behaviour when visual cues were reduced. In contrast, ON/ON participants

 significant computational challenges that limit efficiency and scalability. This thesis investigates

 monitoring either the change of parameter norm or the stability of the NTK, to dynamically identify
 the optimal switch point. This methodology is systematically evaluated on two distinct tasks: image
 classification with the Fashion-MNIST dataset and regression with the Wine Quality dataset. We
 implement and compare three different NTK update methods against a pure SGD baseline across
 networks of varying widths. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid approach, particularly a

107992,Cognitive Bias Modification Training Targeting Implicit Self-Compassion : Investigating the Role of Self-Focused Attention,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107992,"Background: Implicit Self-Compassion (ISC), a pre-conscious tendency to treat oneself with kindness, supports emotional regulation and mental well-being. Across non-clinical and clinical populations, Self-Focused Attention (SFA) is considered a key mechanism through which self-compassion may promote better mental health outcomes. Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) is a digital intervention designed to retrain automatic cognitive patterns by redirecting attention. By targeting implicit processes, CBM may strengthen ISC across kindness, mindfulness, and common humanity, thereby reducing SFA.Objective: This study examined whether a brief CBM intervention enhances ISC and reduces SFA, and whether changes in ISC mediate, or baseline SFA moderates, these effects.
Method: A randomized pre-post design examined the effects of a three-day CBM intervention delivered via the TIIM mobile app, with 31 participants in the CBM group and 10 in the no-training control group (n = 41). ISC was assessed via three brief Implicit Association Tests (IATs), measuring automatic self-associations. Mediation and moderation models investigated underlying mechanisms.
Results: The CBM intervention did not significantly increase ISC compared to controls. Mixed ANOVA showed no significant time × group interaction (p = .146), and mediation analyses revealed no indirect effects of CBM on SFA via the three ISC subcomponents. Baseline SFA did not moderate intervention effects. Exploratory findings suggested greater improvements in those with lower initial ISC, though overall effects remained nonsignificant.
Conclusion: This study found no significant evidence that brief CBM enhanced ISC or reduced SFA, underscoring the need for more robust designs and refined measures targeting implicit self-processes.

107990,Epistemic Risks of Applying AI in Psychodiagnostics,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107990,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into mental healthcare services is said to offer promising solutions to present practical issues in the field, including rising prevalences and therapeutic demand, accessibility gaps, or resource limitations. This thesis critically examines crucial epistemic risks stemming from an integration of AI systems into mental healthcare services, particularly psychodiagnostic practices. The primary question being researched is: “In what ways is the application of AI in psychodiagnostics epistemically problematic, particularly regarding biases, risks, and epistemic oppression?” Sub-questions include how AI interacts with existing epistemic risks, what novel risks it introduces, and whether current mitigation strategies are sufficient. I begin by exploring literature on existing epistemic risks in traditional psychodiagnostics, viewed through the lens of Bradburn et al.’s (2017) theory of measurement. Drawing on this theory, epistemic risks are identified across three stages of psychodiagnostic measurement: characterization, representation, and procedures. Furthermore, it is highlighted how epistemic oppression, particularly through sampling bias, also poses relevant epistemic risk as diverse perspective in knowledge production are limited. Building on this, epistemic risks of AI integration are analyzed to understand how they interact with existing risks, and how it introduces additional risks. Central findings show how the opacity of AI systems impairs understanding of decision-making processes and potentially amplifies existing biases and epistemic injustices. Current remedial measures, such as Explainable AI and Machine Unlearning, are, after critical evaluation, found to be inadequate in addressing epistemic challenges. The case study of Aiberry, a mental health assessment tool, is used to exemplify how theoretical epistemic risks manifest in practice. This case study demonstrates how biased data, unclear diagnostic criteria, or limited interpretability can result in flawed validations and potentially harmful consequences. Overall, it was found that AI integration into psychodiagnostics not only introduces novel epistemic risk but further amplifies and consolidates existing ones, increasing the difficulty to detect and mitigate them. This poses a significant epistemic threat to psychodiagnostics. Furthermore, potential initial steps to mitigate epistemic risks are mentioned, consisting of systemic thinking and epistemic friction approaches. The study concludes by discussing examples of broader applicability of its findings to other fields.","Master Philosophy of Science, Technology and Society (M-PSTS)","Känder, F.K.",July 2025,English,"No

These were evaluated through interviews with office workers. Results indicate that while automation can streamline planning and execution, it may reduce user agency and depends on trust in the system. Aligning new tools with existing workflows was also key for adoption.

107983,A Data-Driven Unsupervised Deep Learning Approach for Anomaly Detection Under Varying Temperature Conditions.,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107983,"Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) faces significant challenges in reliably distinguishing between environmental effects, particularly temperature variability, and structural damage. This study presents an unsupervised deep learning approach to enhance anomaly detection accuracy by directly incorporating ambient and distributed temperature measurements into the learning process. By integrating temperature information within a deep learning model the proposed approach implicitly captures temperature-induced variability, effectively isolating structural anomalies from temperature-induced changes. The approach was validated using two distinct case studies: a laboratory-scale aluminum truss subjected to quasi-static strain scenarios, and the full-scale Z24 bridge monitored through dynamic vibration responses.

107981,Envisioning the EU : The Relationship between Sustainability and Artificial Intelligence from a policymaking perspective,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107981,"Sustainability and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly interlinked in the discourse surrounding technological innovation, as AI is seen as both a transformative tool for advancing sustainability goals and, at the same time, a technology that presents significant environmental challenges. While AI models, especially generative AI (GenAI), are praised for their potential to address global sustainability issues, they also contribute to carbon emissions and consume vast amounts of energy during their training and operational phases (Soham, 2024). This duality creates a critical tension that policymakers are yet to fully address. The European Union (EU), for example, has already begun to take action regarding generative AI through the landmark AI Act, which is being negotiated with an emphasis on sustainability-oriented criteria such as energy use, water consumption, and CO2 emissions from data centers that host AI models. However, despite these efforts, policymakers seem to have a limited understanding of the environmental impact of AI and how these challenges complicate the pursuit of sustainability.
Policymakers in the EU view AI as an essential tool for achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly given the urgency of addressing climate change, as only 17% of SDG targets are on track (Yinuo, 2024). The EU is funding a variety of research initiatives under Horizon Europe, which explores the integration of AI into sustainability solutions and focuses on mitigating the environmental impact of generative AI. In addition, policymakers are advocating for cross-sector collaboration to decarbonize various industries through digital infrastructure and AI technologies (Accelerating the Green Transition: The Role of Digital Infrastructures in Decarbonising Energy and Mobility Sectors, 2024). However, while these initiatives highlight the potential for AI to drive sustainability, there is a significant gap in the way policymakers acknowledge the technology’s high environmental costs, particularly the unsustainability of GenAI. As it stands, generative AI is one of the most energy-intensive technologies, yet policymakers seem to overlook or downplay its ecological footprint. This gap in awareness raises crucial questions about the true sustainability of AI as a tool for addressing climate change.
The research question that this thesis aims to explore is: ""How do policymakers in the EU envision the relationship between sustainability and AI?"" In addition, the research will examine the sub-question: ""In what ways do policymakers recognize the problematic relationship between AI and sustainability?"" This research seeks to address the gap in understanding by investigating whether policymakers are aware of AI’s environmental impact, and if they are, how that awareness influences the implementation of AI in sustainability efforts. This gap exists because much of the current discourse around AI and sustainability has been overly optimistic, focusing on AI’s potential to solve sustainability challenges while downplaying its own environmental costs. Additionally, many policymakers and industry leaders have been more focused on scaling AI as a solution to climate change rather than addressing its contribution to the very problem they aim to solve.","Bachelor Management, Society and Technology (B-MST)","Mihaila, Ion-Luca",July 2025,English,"No

the bicycle in the Netherlands. Single-Bicycle Crashes (SBCs) are a type of cycling crash which is heavily underreported,
since they do not involve other vehicles and are usually attributed to the cyclist’s interaction with the environment. On
the other hand, Non-Single-Bicycle Crashes (Non-SBCs) are those cycling crashes that involve other vehicles. Thus,
to assess the effects of infrastructure and built-environment factors on SBCs and Non-SBCs at urban intersections in
Flevoland, this study develops Safety Performance Functions (SPFs) using ambulance crash data (ranging from 2013 to
2024), traffic volume data, and demographic data, which are processed with Geographic Information Systems. The effects
of these variables are computed with a Negative Binomial Regression for coefficient estimation, from which bicycle and
motor volumes, along with cycling infrastructure, resulted as the strongest crash predictors. Proximity to major attractors
showed speed-depending effects. With the estimated coefficients, the SPFs are assembled. An Empirical-Bayes adjustment

However, its current transport management process is unstructured, manual, and not scalable, requiring disproportionate staffing as operations grow. This research addresses the core issue: the transport process cannot support international expansion without a significant rise in coordination workload. The study aims to reduce staffing needs from 1.6 to 0.5 full-time employees (FTEs) per site by designing a scalable transport process. Using interviews, process modeling, literature on business process redesign, and KPI analysis, three key solutions are proposed: (1) implementing a Transport Management System (TMS) for automation and visibility, (2) automating documentation and valuation tasks to reduce workload and errors, and (3) standardizing the transport coordination role across all sites. Evaluation shows the new process reduces staffing needs to 0.67 FTEs per site, enhances efficiency, and minimizes dependency on specific employees. The redesign supports international scalability while maintaining service levels and operational control.

This study evaluates the accuracy of a triangulation-based 3D pose estimation method that combines stereo camera input with Real-Time Multi-Person Pose Estimation (RTMO). The method estimates sagittal knee and hip angles during soccer-specific movements in a field-based setting. Twelve healthy soccer players performed running at various subject-camera distances, sprinting, and jumping on a soccer field while recorded by two synchronized GoPro cameras. Eight lower-body inertial measurement units (IMUs) provided reference angles. The RTMO model extracted 2D keypoints from both views, which were triangulated to compute 3D joint positions and calculate knee and hip flexion/extension. Results show strong agreement with the IMU-based reference for running at short distances (2–4 m), where Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) exceeded 0.90 and root mean square error (RMSE) remained below 10° for both joints. At 8 m, accuracy decreased (RMSE = 23.74°, r = 0.80). Sprinting at 2.5 m exhibited higher RMSEs than running, while jumping yielded the lowest knee RMSE (5.11°) and highest r (0.98).

Using the large language model (LLM) GPT-4o as a deductive text mining tool, it evaluated the alignment of popular posts with the Connectedness, Hope, Identity, Meaning, Empowerment (CHIME) model of personal recovery and assessed emotional tone.
A total of 991 posts from r/CPTSD and 1001 posts from r/CPTSDNextSteps were scraped on April 4, 2025. Zero-shot GPT-4o scores (1-7 Likert scale) were validated against independent human raters with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC(2,1)). Comparative analyses tested differences in GPT-4o sentiment and CHIME scores across subreddits. 
r/CPTSDNextSteps posts scored significantly higher in sentiment (p < .001, d = 1.06), Hope (p < .001, d = 1.68) and Empowerment (p < .001, d = 1.38), while r/CPTSD posts scored higher on Meaning (p < .001, d = -0.46). GPT-4o showed good to excellent agreement with human ratings (ICCs ≥ 0.60) for sentiment, Connectedness, Hope and Empowerment across both subreddits, but only poor to fair agreement for Identity and Meaning in r/CPTSD.

107970,Alignment of Induction Programs with Beginning Teachers’ Needs : A Policy and Practice Perspective,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107970,"The transition from teacher training to professional teaching is a critical phase in a
teacher’s career. To support beginning teachers during this phase, induction programs are
conducted and aim to address their challenges and needs. Induction programs consist of
aspects such as workload reduction, coaching, enculturation and professionalization. The
effectiveness of induction programs, however, is influenced by the extent to which the
induction offer aligns with the needs of beginning teachers, and by how adaptive it is.
This research focuses on the alignment between the policy documents of school
boards regarding induction programs, and the actual needs of beginning teachers in Dutch
primary education. Through policy documents analysis of twelve school boards and
comparing these with the survey data of 38 beginning teachers, it is investigated which
induction measures are (experienced as) offered, to what extent they are adaptive, and to what
extent they align with the needs of the beginning teachers. There is also particular attention
given to how adaptivity in policy relates to the induction offer that teachers experience in
practice and the support they report needing.
The results show that mainly coaching is structurally included in policy, while aspects
such as workload reduction and professionalization are only limitedly present. Enculturation
is moderately included. In practice, beginning teachers experience most support in coaching
and enculturation, but there appears to be more support experienced in practice than included
in policy at most school boards. Adaptive elements — such as differentiated support, ongoing
development, and teacher involvement — are included in half of the school boards’ policies
and show varying correspondence with what teachers have reported as their experienced and
needed support.
An important insight of this research is that there is on multiple fronts no alignment
between policy, practice, and the needs of beginning teachers, especially regarding workload
reduction and professionalization. This hinders the effectiveness of induction programs and increases the risk of teacher attrition. School boards are therefore being advised to (further)
adapt the induction to the needs of beginning teachers, to enhance teacher effectiveness, job
satisfaction, and teacher retention.

This thesis investigates the applicability of these methods on large scale knowledge graphs. Fundamental flaws are found with inspection and filtering based approaches, while encryption is not suitable to the further problem context. The scalability of query rewriting and data preselection is investigated using different triple stores. This shows that the performance is largely dependent on the underlying triple store.

evaluates the performance of large language models (LLMs) in solving the same issues by

on open coding and card sorting of the questions identified four key activities, which
developers pursue when dealing with energy-related concerns: optimizing code to lower
energy use, gathering power consumption data, fixing bugs related to energy consumption
and intentionally circumventing energy-saving features to achieve required functionality.
Developers frequently express frustration with limited tool support, poorly documented energy behaviours across platforms, and possible ways to boost software performance. LDA
produced a complementary set of themes, including battery drain, background service constraints, and device communication. Together, these results reveal that while developers
not only reduce power consumption by optimizing code, but they also tend to work around

Clinically, distinguishing between identical and non-identical bursting is crucial for prognosis. Identical bursting has been hypothesized to reflect low-dimensional brain dynamics resulting from severely damaged inhibitory circuits, while non-identical bursts are expected to indicate higher-dimensional dynamics resulting from preserved inhibition and brain function. In this thesis, we aim to discover whether these differences in burst identicality correspond to distinct states of dynamical complexity by implementing the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) framework, extended with HAVOK analysis and Ensemble SINDy. Validation on data from the Lorenz attractor and a burst-suppression model confirms the method’s functioning, as the SINDy-modeled systems accurately capture the majority of the underlying dynamics of the input data. The implementation of the method on real-world burst EEG segments reveals challenges, including high signal complexity, noise sensitivity, and limitations in numerical differentiation. Strategies such as hyperparameter tuning, temporal upsampling, applying alternative error metrics, and regularized differentiation did not resolve these problems. Based on these findings, we suggest that autoencoder SINDy may be more effective, as it enables nonlinear decomposition of the input data, in contrast to the linear decomposition performed in HAVOK analysis.

107958,The influence of hepatic stellate cells (LX-2) on endothelial function in a biomimetic Vessel-on-Chip (VoC) model of the liver sinusoid,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107958,"This thesis explores the development of a liver sinusoid-on-chip model with a co-culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and hepatic stellate cells (LX-2). The aim was to replicate a liver sinusoid micro-environment and investigate how LX-2 cells influence endothelial barrier function. The liver sinusoid-on-chip was designed with five compartments: a main channel for seeding the HUVECs, two adjacent collagen channels filled with a collagen and LX-2 cell mix, and two outer side channels for LX-2 medium. The fabrication of the chip involved PDMS molding, plasma bonding, polydopamine (PDA) treatment, and collagen embedding followed by cell seeding. Throughout this study, several challenges were encountered, particularly in obtaining viable cells. Despite an effort to improve the seeding protocol, most LX-2 cells did not survive. The HUVECs grew more reliable, although they did not consistently form a tight monolayer. An permeability assay showed some formation of endothelial layers, but results varied between chips and they were more permeable than previous designs. The hypothesis suggested that co-culturing LX-2 cells with HUVECs would enhance the tightness of the endothelial barrier, however this could not be confirmed due to poor survival of the LX-2 cells. Still, this study gave helpful insights into how the chip is made and how the cells grow. Although the current model still needs improvement, it provides a good starting point for future research on the liver sinusoid. With some adjustments, the model could be useful for studying liver diseases and metastasis.",Bachelor Biomedical Engineering (B-BMT),"Jong, C.N. de",July 2025,English,"No

107957,Grouped Product Recognition from Images of Supermarket Shelves using Machine Learning,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107957,"With the growing number and variety of products in supermarkets, managing retail shelves manually is time-consuming and prone to human error, making it difficult for staff to recognize and organize them efficiently. This work focuses on detecting and grouping similar or identical products from shelf images. In this project, we proposed a novel unsupervised, three-stage framework for grouped product recognition in supermarket environments, consisting of: (a) grocery product detection, (b) product characterization, and (c) grouped product recognition. For grocery product detection, we employ YOLOv5 to detect and locate each grocery object, and for product characterization, we extract multiple types of features, including CNN-based deep features, color histograms, shape and texture information, text from packaging, and product position on the shelf. Finally, in the grouped product recognition stage, we apply unsupervised clustering algorithms, including OPTICS and Agglomerative Clustering, to group similar products. We also evaluate the effectiveness of recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) for product detection and localization, and compare their performance with our proposed framework. Experimental results on public and real Dutch supermarket datasets show that the combination of CNN, color, and spatial features achieved the highest clustering performance, with an ARI of 0.7894, NMI of 0.8020, and Silhouette Score of 0.0358 on the Grocery Products dataset.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Huang, H.",January 2025,English,"No

rewilding, are reflected in practice. This is done through a case study of part of the Spoorzone in 
Zwolle. Urban rewilding reintroduces wildness, both flora and fauna, into cities, supports biodiversity,
and reconnects people with nature. 
To find how urban rewilding is reflected in practice, a literature review based on scientific literature is 
conducted first. This resulted in a theoretical framework that identified the success factors of urban 
rewilding for each aspect. The aspects found are political, social, hydrological, economic, ecological, 
and technical & design. A pattern-matching procedure was done to match the framework with the 
case. Information about the case was gathered through expert interviews and project 
documentation. 
The research revealed that while not all success factors are present in Wärtz, many are addressed 
through balances with regulations and context. The case shows that the theory of urban rewilding 
often does not fully align with the practice of urban rewilding, but serves more as a guideline to 
combine with considerations shaped by context. Based on the results of the pattern-matching 
procedure, recommendations for Haskoning could be made. Recommendations for the 
implementation and management of the political and economic aspects are made. 
Despite the research having limitations concerning the single-case study, the theoretical framework 
with success factors for urban rewilding that is developed could offer valuable information for cities 
that also want to incorporate urban rewilding. This research shows that urban rewilding can be 
incorporated into cities and can even be successful when not all success factors are achieved.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Plas, R.W.H.",July 2025,English,"No

107954,Evaluating the Implementation of Circular Design Strategies in Timber Construction,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107954,"The building and construction sector remains a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and
resource depletion. Timber offers a promising circular alternative, yet its uptake in Portugal is still
nascent. This thesis examines how far six circular design strategies- Design for Disassembly & Reuse,
Adaptability, Renewable Raw Materials, Reused Parts, Long-Term Quality & Maintenance, and
Modularity & Prefabrication- are embedded in two engineered-timber projects by Vanguard
Properties: a house in the Muda Reserve and the Torre showroom house in Comporta. A structured
framework was developed from the Dutch Platform CB’23 guideline and recent academic work, then
applied to both cases through a triangulation of (i) technical-document analysis, (ii) semi-structured
interviews with project and factory teams, and (iii) an on-site tour of Kōzōwood Industries’
CLT/wood-frame production line. Results show strong implementation of Renewable Raw Materials
and Long-Term Quality & Maintenance thanks to FSC/PEFC-certified timber, off-site CNC
fabrication and detailed maintenance manuals. Design for Disassembly & Reuse, Adaptability, and
Modularity & Prefabrication rate medium: use of mechanical fasteners and prefabricated 2-D panels
supports future changes, yet the absence of digital material passports, end-of-life plans and 3-D
modular units limits full circular potential. Design with Reused Parts scores low because reclaimed
timber is not yet sourced at scale. The study successfully applies the developed framework to
real-world timber projects and highlights the extent to which Vanguard Properties’ projects are
circular. The results show that the circular economy principles present are embedded within their
construction methods and are not yet intentionally accounted for. To reach the near full extent of
circularity in their projects, this research highlights the following recommendations: (1) implement
digital material passports and end-of-life road-maps, (2) integrate reclaimed-timber supply chains, and

While each synucleinopathy requires disease specific treatment, diagnosis is challenging since patients share common symptoms. Therefore, a fast and reliable discrimination of α-synuclein fibril polymorphs is clinically highly desirable. In this thesis, several polymorph discrimination methods are explored, mainly targeting the fuzzy coat of fibrils through a gel electrophoresis-based proteinase K digestion assay. Gel electrophoresis data was successfully quantified by constructing intensity profiles (IPs) from gel images. From these IPs, polymorph specific Proteinase K digestion sites were discovered for A53T and E46K point mutated strains that aggregated in high salt (HS) and low salt (LS) conditions. For the WT strain, only Proteinase K characteristic digestion sites were established for fibrils that aggregated in HS conditions, since aggregation in LS conditions yielded too few fibrils to be investigated. The results of this thesis lay the foundation for promising, novel and fast α-synuclein fibril polymorph discrimination methods, having the potential to enhance the diagnosis and targeted treatment of synucleinopathies.",Master Biomedical Engineering (M-BME),"Os, O.J.D. van",July 2025,English,"No.

Over a multi-week period, 28 telescope nodes were deployed across Tencent Cloud (Asia-Pacific) and DigitalOcean (US/Europe), capturing millions of unsolicited connection attempts. Our analysis reveals notable differences in traffic volume, port targeting, and scan behavior between regions, with Tencent Cloud observing higher volumes and more persistent scanning campaigns. These results suggest that geographic diversity and provider-aware deployments can significantly improve IBR observability while reducing measurement bias.

Current estimations, often based on experience, fail to reflect real-world variability, with 78% of shipments missing the planned delivery date. Key challenges include limited visibility in inland transport, customs delays, and last-mile uncertainties. To address this, predictive models were developed using historical shipment data. An XGBoost model for direct shipments achieved an R² of 0.86 and a MAE of 1.36 days. For cost estimation, a multiple linear regression model reached an R² of 0.99 and a coefficient of variation of 5.31%. Additionally, a rule-based simulation model was designed to estimate lead time and cost in a warehouse distribution scenario.

There is a need for better surgeries than current options. One such proposed surgery is to use an untethered micro robot (UMR) that has been equipped with barbs to penetrate and then extract the thrombus. The idea is to pull the clot out either as a whole or as fragments.
The purpose of my research is to evaluate the feasibility of this approach. To that end, the frequency response of the UMR is evaluated for different payloads and in different swimming media with different viscosities. The research generally showed that the average velocity over a 52 mm path is not strictly increasing with frequency. Some of the heavier payloads required a minimum frequency to swim at all, while smaller payloads often had a maximum velocity at a frequency other than the highest.
While these experiments did not feature flow, this data suggests that the proposed surgery may only be viable with lighter clots in environments with small flow.
The set-up did not feature realistic walls. These may be varicose in thrombotic patients which makes modeling them difficult.

Using a web-based interface, it translates four key urban form metrics—Building Age, Building Height, Land Use, and Street Pattern—into structured visual and auditory signals. The study employs Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to group urban blocks based on these metrics and applies Parameter Mapping Sonification to convey data through sound variables and compositional elements such as tempo, register, timbre, and harmony. A mixed-method usability study was conducted with 25 participants to evaluate comprehension, cognitive load, and modality preferences across audio-only, visual-only, and combined audio-visual tasks.
Quantitative results showed that while visual-only tasks were most accurate overall, combined modalities often improved response times and user confidence. Participants with higher musical perception demonstrated better performance in interpreting sonified data. Qualitative interviews revealed that sonification enhanced emotional engagement, spurred curiosity, and in some cases, led to novel urban insights, particularly where visual representations posed challenges. The findings highlight both the promise and limitations of sonification in urban analysis, calling for thoughtful, non-redundant multimodal design.

107938,"A Scoping Review of Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Mental Health : Design, Frameworks, and Reporting Completeness",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107938,"Background: Mental disorders are a major global health burden. Although the use of digital 
mental health interventions increases, they often lack personalization. Just-in-time adaptive 
interventions (JITAIs) offer a promising approach by delivering real-time, context-sensitive 
support. While the field of JITAIs is growing, little is known about how well mental health 
JITAIs are grounded in theory and whether they are reported with sufficient detail for 
replication. Theoretical frameworks can help identify key factors that drive change, such as 
motivation and self-monitoring, and improve the use of behaviour change techniques. This 
scoping review provides an overview of the study and sample characteristics, theoretical 
foundations, and reporting completeness of JITAIs targeting mental health outcomes. 
Method: A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and PsychINFO was conducted on 
January 27th, 2025. Studies were included if they employed a quantitative empirical design,
focused on mental health outcomes in either clinical or non-clinical populations, and used a 
technology-delivered intervention tailored to users’ internal state and/or context. A narrative 
synthesis was used to summarize the findings, and the completeness of reporting was assessed 
using a 12-item checklist. 
Results: Eleven studies with a total of 1114 participants were included. Most interventions 
targeted depression, schizophrenia, PTSD, or bipolar disorder, and were delivered via mobile 
application. Nine of the studies reported using a theoretical framework, most commonly 
behavioural theories, or computational models (data-driven algorithms that simulate mental 
health processes). However, links to key JITAI design elements such as tailoring variables 
often remained unclear. Reporting completeness, meaning how thoroughly the authors 
described information necessary for replication, was generally high (> 90%), although gaps 
remained in data security. 
Discussion: JITAIs show promising potential for supporting mental health by offering timely, 
personalized, and context-sensitive interventions. Even though most included studies reported 
use of theoretical frameworks, the application to specific JITAI design components was often 
insufficiently described. This limits transparency and makes it challenging to understand how 
and why interventions work. Although overall reporting quality was high, future research 
should provide clearer descriptions of theory use across design components to improve 
understanding of how and why interventions work and to further strengthen replicability.

In this study, we examined (1) whether social isolation and loneliness predict adherence, (2) whether human guidance moderated this effect, and (3) whether eligible participants would participate more during or before the COVID-19 pandemic. The data of 11,994 university students with mild, moderate, or severe anxiety and/or depression were analyzed using multiple linear regression models with and without interaction terms (demographic data is missing for over 93% of participants). Male gender predicted lower adherence than female gender, and human guidance predicted higher adherence than technological guidance. As a result, social isolation and loneliness did not significantly predict adherence, and human guidance did not moderate the relationship between these variables.

This study examines which configurational set of determinants explains the decision to adopt Robotic Milking Systems (RMS) in the Netherlands, Germany, France and Poland. Eighteen farmers selected for maximum variation in herd size, land use, and current technology level were interviewed; transcripts were scored and analyzed with fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis. One dominant adoption pathway was revealed: the self-driven pioneer—a larger-than-average farm run by an entrepreneur with a strong personal pro-innovation attitude who decides independently of peers or suppliers. Two contrasting pathways explain non-adoption. The risk-averse family farm couples below-average size with distrust of unfamiliar technologies and satisfaction with its current scale. The welfare traditionalist prioritises animal health, trusts personal husbandry skills over technology and expands while staying true to tradition. These configurational insights extend technology-acceptance models (TAM/UTAUT) by exposing the sector’s causal complexity.

A fundamental requirement in these systems is the ability to localize users with high precision, low latency, and minimal energy overhead. However, accurate and scalable positioning in energy-constrained deployments remains a significant challenge. Existing techniques often rely on dedicated positioning signals or frequent uplink transmissions, leading to increased energy consumption at the user equipment and unnecessary activation of infrastructure. These limitations hinders the adoption of positioning in large-scale, distributed wireless networks. This thesis proposes a two-phase positioning protocol for wireless sensing scenarios in 6G networks. In the first phase, an uplink preamble signal is used to obtain a coarse estimate of the user equipment's position while selectively activating a small number of transmission-reception points based on signal-to-noise ratio and estimated range. The second phase refines the positioning estimation from the first phase by employing monostatic sensing using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing waveforms, with two beamforming strategies: beam-focusing and beam-sweeping.",Bachelor Electrical Engineering (B-EE),"Zhou, A.",July 2025,English,"No

107926,Improving the Quality Registration System (QRS) at Kawneer,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107926,"This thesis addresses inefficiencies in Kawneer’s current Quality Registration System (QRS), which handles approximately eight customer complaints per day. The existing process is fragmented, relying on emails, Excel sheets, and disparate systems for registration, communication, and tracking. This lack of integration results in poor status visibility, duplicated efforts, and delays in complaint resolution, ultimately impacting customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. The research objective was to design an improved QRS that connects complaint-related information and provides clear, real-time visibility of complaint status, aiming to reduce the average complaint process time by 1–3%. To achieve this, Salesforce and HubBase, two software solutions already partially in use at Kawneer, were evaluated as potential workflow management systems (WFMS), capable of streamlining the complaint-handling process. The study combines the Managerial Problem Solving Method (MPSM) framework with Robinson’s (2004) Simulation Study methodology, which guided the development of conceptual models, model coding, validation, and experimentation. Stochastic discrete-event simulations were used to model the current process and the two proposed solutions under realistic variability, enabling systematic comparison of their performance. Key performance indicators included process time, information connectivity, status visibility, and operational cost. The results demonstrate that both Salesforce and HubBase outperform the current QRS, with Salesforce delivering the largest improvements in efficiency and cost-effectiveness. An implementation plan for Salesforce is proposed, including mid- and long-term actions.

At the same time, it introduces growing complexity through regulatory demands, fragmented data, and limited visibility across supply chains. This study investigates how digital technologies support organisations in managing this complexity, based on twelve expert interviews with technology solution providers. Using the ABCDE visibility framework, the study shows that sourcing complexity is closely tied to visibility challenges. A distinction is made between physical visibility, which relates to the traceability of goods, and informational visibility, which concerns the structure and accessibility of procurement and compliance data. Different technologies are needed to address these distinct gaps. An integrated theoretical framework combining the Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) model and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was applied to analyse how technological characteristics, organisational conditions, and environmental factors influence the effectiveness of technology in sourcing contexts. The findings show that sourcing complexity can only be effectively managed when technologies are selected based on the specific problem they are intended to solve. Organisations typically combine specialised tools that address concrete challenges such as ESG compliance, risk monitoring, or supplier data quality. These tools improve the quality, availability, and structure of sourcing information, enabling faster and more evidence-based decision-making in complex global environments. This study contributes by offering a structured explanation of how visibility gaps shape global sourcing complexity and how digital technologies can support targeted, adaptive responses.

This study explores the use of time-series satellite imagery to assess vegetation responses to geothermal activity in the Papandayan geothermal field, West Java, Indonesia. By analysing multitemporal Sentinel-2 imagery from 2019 to 2025, four vegetation indices, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Red Edge Position (REP), were evaluated to detect stress patterns across forested zones. The analysis was restricted to forest zones to isolate consistent vegetation conditions using a manually digitized forest mask. Cloud-filtered and atmospherically corrected data were processed using Google Earth Engine.
To validate satellite-derived patterns, vegetation indices were spatially compared with field-based data, including radon and mercury soil gas concentrations and geological fault maps. Results revealed generally healthy vegetation across the study period, with seasonal patterns visible in NDVI and REP. Slightly lower vegetation index values were observed in high-radon zones, suggesting potential localized stress. However, spatial correlations with fault proximity and mercury levels were weak. A notable exception was observed near a fault–river intersection with geothermal manifestations, where NDVI values were lower.
While integrating satellite time series with field data offered valuable context, the relationship between geothermal factors and vegetation response appeared limited at the observed scale.

Additionally, this study aims to determine the mass and distribution of fragments on a WCR after a retrieval failure. To do that, this study uses a stereo reflection microscope, to look at the UMR entering the phantom blood clot in a clear tube, and by recording its retrieval, factors like the stiction between the UMR and the clot and the deformation of the clot are determined. By doing this multiple times the consistency of the retrieval is also determined. The fragmentation mass and distribution are also determined using the microscope.

The aim of this thesis is to use Social Network Analysis (SNA) as well as Agent-based Modeling (ABM) for a better understanding of the evolution of inter-firm collaboration in the IS context.
The introduction shows why SNA’s structural insights should be coupled with the actor-based model (ABM) to drive better insights than static or siloed methods. The research address the methodological gap of current IS modeling.
A systematic literature review was performed using Scopus and identified 28 high-quality peer-reviewed studies that jointly applied SNA and ABM. A three-stage selection funnel is used in the methodology. The focus is on translating metrics, modeling trust and interaction mechanisms.
The results for the research questions indicate that SNA measures of degree and betweenness centrality frequently find their way in the decision rules of agents in the ABM. These SNA measures determine how agents behave across the spectrum of the categories of reactive, deliberative and hybrid. The model realism of the research questions gets higher due to acceptance and trust that allow IS to have better networks.
The synthesis section highlights that integration improves realism and strategic insights. However, the challenges are limited empirical validation, insufficient modeling of political governance layers, and frameworks varying across studies.
In conclusion, the combination of SNA and ABM provides a more natural way to understand IS network formation in terms of structure and agency.

A key element is the planning of Technisch Onderhoud (TO) slots, which are short but frequently occurring maintenance slots scheduled nine to twelve months before each season. Current capacity guidelines have remained similar for a long period, leading to uncertainty about their alignment with actual maintenance needs. This research aims to improve TO slot planning by determining the optimal number and durations of TO slots per week and aircraft type, based on predicted maintenance workload. A Random Forest (RF) model was developed to predict weekly workload. Even though several improvement efforts, prediction performance remained limited. However, by sampling predictions from individual trees allowed scenario generation that captures workload uncertainty. Two optimisation models were built: a Deterministic Capacity Planning Model (DCPM) and a Stochastic Capacity Planning Model (SCPM). Results show that the SCPM generally leads to lower costs and better alignment with actual maintenance needs, as shown by a positive Value of the Stochastic Solution. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis shows a strong sensitivity on cost parameters, with overestimation sometimes preferable when undercapacity penalties are high.

107910,Optimizing the employee scheduling of the service bureau of Company X,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107910,"This research was conducted at Company X, a multidisciplinary foot care organization, to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of its central service bureau. The service bureau, which handles both
inbound and outbound communication tasks, has experienced increasing workload complexity, primarily
due to the company’s expansion. The main operational challenge addressed in this study is the high
proportion of missed incoming phone calls, despite adequate staffing levels, due to the lack of data-driven
workforce planning.
The central research question of this thesis was:
“How can a data-driven scheduling approach be used to improve the quality of service for incoming calls
at the service bureau from 68.1% to 80%?”
To address this, a six-phase research approach was adopted. First, the current situation was assessed,
including existing scheduling methods and performance metrics. The Quality of Service (QoS), defined
as the percentage of calls answered within 120 seconds, was introduced as a more patient-centered performance indicator. The current QoS stood at 68.1%, with a desired target of 80%.
Next, relevant literature was reviewed to identify suitable workforce planning techniques. A hybrid
modeling framework was selected, combining queueing theory (Erlang C and Erlang A models) for determining required staffing levels and a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model for generating feasible
employee schedules. The Erlang C model, despite not accounting for abandonment behavior, provided
the best fit to historical call data.
In the solution design, historical data from 2025 were used to statistically model call arrivals, service
durations, and abandonment rates. These were translated into staffing demands for half-hour intervals
using the Erlang models. The resulting demand tables were then used as input for the MIP model,
which optimized schedules under real-world constraints such as employee availability and working hour
regulations. A detailed Python implementation was developed for both model components.
The model was tested using historical data, comparing predicted versus actual performance over
several weeks. Results showed that the data-driven approach could generate schedules that meet the
80% QoS target in most intervals. A comparison of model-generated and actual schedules demonstrated
increased efficiency and better alignment of staff supply with demand. A sensitivity analysis revealed
how changes in personal queue time impact staffing requirements.
From a practical perspective, this research provides a scalable and structured framework for employee
scheduling that reduces manual workload for planners and better aligns staffing with call demand. It
also led to the creation of a performance dashboard, increasing visibility into individual and team performance. This has shifted managerial focus toward the service bureau and enabled data-driven performance
monitoring. Insights such as the impact of personal queue time have already prompted managerial action, and the company is now actively exploring the integration of the model into dedicated planning
software to support ongoing operational improvements.
From a scientific perspective, this research contributes by comparing the performance of Erlang A
and Erlang C models in a real-world setting, highlighting the practical implications of incorporating customer abandonment into staffing decisions. Additionally, it introduces the inclusion of personal queue
time into the service rate, resulting in a more realistic and applicable queuing model for service environments. These adaptations help bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and operational practice.
Key limitations include reliance on simplified assumptions (e.g., identical employee productivity)
and use of average input parameters rather than dynamic forecasts. Future research should explore
simulation-based models to account for abandonment and variability in employee performance and consider integrating outbound tasks and workload forecasting to improve planning accuracy.",Bachelor Industrial Engineering & Management Science (B-IEM),"Boonman, Floris-Jan",July 2025,English,"No

While previous studies relied on cross-sectional methods, this study explores the dynamic relationship between need fulfillment and self-confidence through a multi-level analysis by using a weekly diary method. For this study, fifty-eight interns reported their need fulfillment and self-confidence in relation to a specific experience of their past week, during an internship of about five months. Our findings indicated that competence significantly predicts self-confidence both within and between individuals. Self-confidence was linked to within-person variations in relatedness, but there was no significant relationship at between-person level. At either level, autonomy was not a significant predictor of self-confidence. Finally, the study found no overall increase in interns’ self-confidence during the internship.

This study explores how spatial and temporal variables affect cycling activity across Greater London using an interpretable machine learning method. The gradient boosting model (XGBoost) was developed to predict bike count based on temporal conditions (time of day and weather), cycling infrastructure (proximity to facilities and road/lane type), and built environment (distance to city center, density, and elevation). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were applied for both global and local interpretation of model predictions. Results show that infrastructure variables, such as road type, cycle lane design, and proximity to bike share stations, have the strongest predictive power, followed by built environment variables. Temporal variables, especially peak hours, also contribute to the model's performance. The weather had the least effect due to limited variation in the dataset. SHAP enabled interpretation by ranking variable importance, revealing spatial variations, identifying non-linear effects, and detecting threshold values.

107898,Utililzing Artificial Intelligence to enrich self-tracking feedback in bodybuilding,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107898,"There are thousands of different self-tracking devices. Smartwatches, smartphones, smart 
rings, digital weight scales, etc. All these devices serve the purpose of gaining self-knowledge 
through numbers. But do these self-tracking devices really serve this purpose if their feedback 
is difficult to understand, lacks personalization and does not stimulate or motivate the users in 
any way. This is the problem that many modern self-tracking devices are facing. They are great 
at gathering data but struggle to present that data in a meaningful way. 
This thesis project investigates the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enrich 
feedback from self-tracking devices in the context of bodybuilding. Through literature review, 
exploratory stakeholder conversations and state-of-the-art analysis a prototype was developed 
that combines objective activity data gathered with a smartwatch and contextual subjective 
user data (age, bodybuilding experience, training goals, health remarks, etc.). Using the 
Google Fit API, it is possible to gather activity data and health metrics and using the Google 
Gemini API, it is possible to analyze this data and create AI generated feedback. Data 
Visualizations, natural language generation and an intuitive user interface ensure the system 
is both accessible and engaging.
The prototype was evaluated through user tests with five bodybuilders. Semi-structured 
interviews and Likert-scale questionnaires allowed to gain deep insight into both quantitative 
and qualitative data. The results indicate good usability, with the users finding the system 
intuitive and easy to understand. The AI generated feedback was seen as both motivating, 
personalized and as a help to reflect. The participants stated long-term analysis and better 
workout recommendations as future enhancements.
This thesis demonstrates that AI is effective in combining objective and subjective data

107896,Minimizing Imbalance in an Insurance Housing Portfolio : A Data-Driven Approach,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107896,"This research investigates the long-term impact of demographic ageing on the residential insurance portfolio of Company X and explores strategies to mitigate its effects. The ageing Dutch population and declining birth rates pose risks to the sustainability of the portfolio, potentially reducing the number of insured clients and leading to downward pressure on market share and upward pressure on premiums. To address this, a forecasting model was developed using historical inflow and outflow data segmented by gender, age, household composition, and either province or social class. The Holt-Winters method was applied to project portfolio trends over 30 years, incorporating mortality data to estimate client development and linking it to market share and premium evolution. The model shows that without intervention, the number of clients will decline, while the housing market continues to grow, resulting in shrinking market share. A negative correlation between premium and client count may cause a self-reinforcing loop of rising premiums and further outflow. A scenario analysis was added, simulating targeted marketing campaigns. Results indicate that a five-year intensive campaign focused on young adults (18–46) in western provinces is most effective.

The analysis draws on two theoretical frameworks geoeconomics and innovation policy theory each associated with a testable hypothesis: one predicting a strategic, state led approach (H1), and the other anticipating a collaborative, innovation driven logic (H2).
To examine these hypotheses, a qualitative document analysis was conducted using Atlas.ti. The dataset comprises official EU communications, Dutch government policies, corporate reports from key industry actors such as ASML and AxeleraAI, and relevant academic literature. Documents were coded using a structured binary coding scheme aligned with the two theoretical logics.
The findings provide strong support for H1 within EU and national government texts, which emphasize strategic autonomy, security, centralized coordination, and supply chain reshoring. In contrast, support for H2 is most evident in corporate and academic sources, where emphasis is placed on research ecosystems, public–private collaboration, and the entrepreneurial role of firms. The strategy also exhibits hybrid characteristics, referencing global competitors as both threats and models, and exposing institutional frictions within the EU.

107893,The Enchanted Atelier : A design game for exploring movement-focused interactions for videogame hardware,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107893,"The video game industry has gained a reputation for incorporating cutting-edge technological advancements to enhance the player experience. At the inception of this field, the degree of experimentation in hardware and software was comparable. However, the current state of the industry is marked by a pronounced imbalance, with hardware experimentation seemingly constrained by the prevailing tendency toward standardisation and usability within the gaming sector. This shift has implications for the hybrid nature of videogame practice, prompting questions about the future of hardware experimentation in the context of evolving technological and cultural landscapes. It is argued that by accepting the current state of the industry, in which the gamepad has become the standard input device in modern gaming, designers could create new hardware using the same protocols used by the gamepad. However, these new designs could incorporate novel forms of input that are not focused on ergonomics and usability. Instead, these novel forms of input would prioritise the aesthetics and qualities of the interactions. In order to substantiate the aforementioned assertion, a research-through-design approach was employed in an effort to ascertain the potential for movement-based interactions to be designed in a manner that would serve to enhance the hybrid nature of video game practice. The two artefacts that emerged from this research were a framework and a design game. The Gamepad Input Language Framework aspires to function as a shared reference point for designers and developers, facilitating discourse concerning the gamepad. This framework provided the foundation for the development of the final artefact, The Enchanted Atelier, a design game for exploring movement-focused interactions for videogames. The design game provides hardware designers with an activity to incorporate into their design process. This activity involves participatory design, which allows for the creation of novel interactions that emerge from the nuances of participants' interactions with their body and surroundings. The result shows effectiveness of the method in ideating rich movement-focused interactions, designed beyond ergonomics and usability, while ensuring compatibility with existing videogame software.",Master Interaction Technology (M-ITECH),"San Gregorio de Lucas, Pablo",July 2025,English,"No

The focus lies on the development of an Analytical Melt Pool Model (AMPM) for optimizing laser power and scan speed at the layer-scale. Key findings show that maintaining the calculated melt pool width within defined limits using optimization algorithms effectively reduces thermal gradients, thereby preventing defects such as keyholing and lack-of-fusion. Laser power emerges as the more effective control parameter, while scan speed adjustment introduces added complexity due to thermal accumulation effects. Step-wise and Newton-Raphson optimization algorithms are applied to selected layers, with the Newton-Raphson method resulting in faster and better convergence. Used independently or in combination with the existing Finite Element (FEM) model from NLR, the AMPM leads to improved microstructural homogeneity and reduced porosity, as shown by experimental results. A multi-scale modelling approach shows strong potential to capture a wide range of overheating mechanisms.

This study uses hyperspectral Raman microspectroscopy to investigate the morphology and chemical composition of hydroxyapatite microcalcifications in the spatial domain, aiming to find differences between benign and malignant breast lesions (including disease progression stages: ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)). This study evaluates the potential of microcalcifications as specific biomarkers for breast cancer. This study analyzed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast samples of 30 female patients, who were diagnosed with benign or malignant lesions. 56x56 um raster scans were acquired from the hydroxyapatite microcalcifications using a Raman spectroscopy system. A pipeline extracted quantitative morphological and chemical features, which were compared between benign and (all disease progression stages of) malignant microcalcifications using t-SNE mapping and statistical tests. Spatial imaging revealed that malignant microcalcifications contain lower carbonate content, higher and more structured protein content, and a more crystalline lattice compared to benign microcalcifications. Unsupervised clustering of the quantitative parameters revealed a gradient from malignant to benign, primarily based on variations in the area, the 1445 cm^-1 peak, and the 960 cm^-1 peak. Statistical tests demonstrated that the following parameters significantly differentiate benign from malignant microcalcification across all stages of disease progression (p<0.01): FWHM of the 960 cm^-1 peak (mean, standard deviation(SD)), intensity and area of the 960 cm^-1 peak (mean), intensity and area of the 1445 cm^-1 peak (mean, SD), red shift of the 1070 cm^-1 peak (mean, SD), and FWHM inverse of the 960 cm^-1 peak (mean, SD).

While policymakers often portray startups as high-risk actors requiring strict oversight, startups construct counter-discourses that emphasize innovation, ethical responsibility, and their strategic role in national competitiveness. Grounded in Vivien Schmidt’s Discursive Institutionalism and Fairclough’s Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), the study analyzes 16 key policy documents and startup communications, complemented by an expert interview. It finds that EU regulatory discourse is characterized by moralized, obligation-driven language, whereas U.S. policy leans toward flexible, innovation-oriented framing. In both regions, startups are frequently discursively flattened—grouped under generic terms that obscure their unique needs. Startups resist these portrayals through rhetorical strategies like burden language, calls for proportionality, and claims to policy participation. They reframe themselves as ethical innovators and indispensable contributors to national innovation ecosystems. The thesis reveals that regulation is not only a technical issue but a discursive struggle over meaning and legitimacy. By identifying how ideational power operates in AI governance, this research highlights the need for more inclusive, startup-sensitive regulatory frameworks that avoid reinforcing structural inequalities while maintaining democratic oversight and ethical integrity.","Bachelor Management, Society and Technology (B-MST)","Exenberger, Luca",July 2025,English,"No

This study assesses the spatio-temporal variability of maize yield in Kenya over the period 1983–2016 by integrating climate trend analysis with crop modelling. Six climate indices derived from CHIRPS precipitation and ERA5 temperature datasets were computed, including mean annual precipitation, consecutive dry days (CDD10), consecutive wet days (CWD10), mean temperature, hot days (>25°C), and cold days (<15°C). The Mann-Kendall trend test was used to detect monotonic changes in these indices across Kenya. Concurrently, maize yields were simulated using the DSSAT CERES-Maize model, calibrated with soil profiles and crop management data. Results showed significant warming trends, particularly in the increase of hot days and decline in cold days, alongside regionally variable precipitation patterns. Simulated maize yields revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations, with notable yield declines in areas experiencing prolonged dry spells. Pearson correlation analysis indicated strong negative associations between maize yield and CDD10, while the relationship with other indices varied spatially.

107877,Is it worth it? : A cost benefit study of AXAL Power’s EV chargers in Spain,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107877,"The goal of this research is to assess the economic feasibility and strategic value of integrating AXAL 
Power’s EV charging stations, specifically the Towerplug® and Towerplug® PROMO into urban areas 
across Spain. The study uses a structured Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) approach to evaluate the long-term financial performance of each charger type and to determine how government incentives, 
discount rates, and charger features influence their viability.
The research addresses two main questions:
1. What are the economic, environmental, and social benefits of integrating AXAL Power’s EV 
charging infrastructure in urban development projects across Spain?
2. How can a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) support strategic decision-making for AXAL Power’s 
market expansion in Spain?
These are explored through 4 sub-questions that examine available financial incentives in Spain, 
quantify charger costs and benefits, and analyze performance under different scenarios. The results 
show that both charger models are financially viable, with positive Net Present Values (NPVs) and 
Benefit-Cost Ratios (BCRs) exceeding 1.0 across all scenarios (Figure 1). The Towerplug® PROMO 
consistently outperforms the Towerplug® due to its added advertising value and higher overall 
benefits, making it especially well-suited for commercial settings. The Towerplug®, while also viable, 
is more sensitive to financial support conditions and is best suited for cost-conscious environments 
such as transit hubs. Sensitivity analysis confirms that government subsidies and discount rates 
significantly influence outcomes, though both chargers remain feasible even in conservative 
scenarios. These results validate the use of CBA as a decision-making tool for AXAL Power and 
support a differentiated deployment strategy aligned with specific urban use cases.
The thesis concludes that both of AXAL’s chargers, Towerplug® and Towerplug® PROMO are 
economically viable across a range of financial scenarios. While public subsidies improve project 
outcomes, the chargers remain profitable even without them. These findings support a differentiated 
deployment strategy; The Towerplug® is more suited for cost-sensitive environments like transit hub, 
while the Towerplug® PROMO is better suited in high-visibility commercial zones. The study also 
highlights the value of CBA as a decision-making tool and recommends that AXAL Power continues 
pursuing public tenders, monitor long term performance and further explore environmental and 
social impacts in future research. Together, these insights offer practical guidance for AXAL’s 
expansion in Spain’s evolving EV infrastructure market.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that AXAL Power’s chargers offer strong economic potential 
in Spain’s urban EV infrastructure market. Strategic use of financial incentives, along with context-appropriate charger deployment, can enhance project success while supporting national goals for

107876,Impact of drought on the strength of grass and the underlying clay layer in dike systems,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107876,"Dikes are vital for flood protection and water management in the Netherlands. With climate 
change increasing the frequency and severity of droughts, there is a growing need to understand 
how drought affects dike integrity. This thesis aims to quantify how drought conditions influence 
the erodibility of grass and clay layers in Dutch dikes (specifically Wadden Sea dikes), focusing on 
wave attack scenarios on the waterside slope (GEBU, a standardized failure mechanism in Dutch 
dike safety assessment). A key objective of this study is to assess how drought alters a newly 
developed erosion coefficient (from the ongoing “Onderzoek Erodeerbaarheid Klei” project) and 
to identify which clay material properties contribute most to increased erosion risk.
The effect of drought on grass revetment was studied using theory from the BM Gras software. The 
analysis involved categorizing drought-affected grass into existing grass quality classes, which 
influence erosion resistance under wave loading. For the clay layer, insights from the recent OEK 
(Onderzoek Erodeerbaarheid Klei) project were used to examine how measurable clay properties
(such as consistency index, water content, and dry density) influence erosion behavior through 
the erosion coefficient. Additionally, this research compares the Mourik formula (currently used 
to understand the erosion of clay) with the OEK formula to evaluate their assumptions and 
predictive capabilities.
The results of the thesis show a degradation of strength in both the grass and clay layers of dike 
systems under drought conditions, making them more erodible and at greater risk during wave 
attack. The effect of drought on grass cover is strongly influenced by pre-drought maintenance 
and site conditions; for example, south-facing slopes are significantly more affected. The most 
vulnerable slopes experienced severe degradation, with large portions of the surface reduced to 
open patches due to grass die-off. This condition leaves the dike highly susceptible to wave attack 
and necessitates reseeding to restore erosion resistance. For the clay layer, drought was found to 
increase erodibility, particularly near the surface. In clay layers less than 0.5 m deep, drought 
conditions can more than double the erosion rate, while deeper layers are less affected due to 
limited moisture loss with depth.
These findings highlight the urgency for further research, particularly in light of current data 
limitations and knowledge gaps related to modeling drought-induced degradation. A major 
constraint in this study was the limited availability of experimental data on drought-affected grass 
and clay. With more comprehensive datasets, it would be possible to derive drought-specific 
parameters that better represent grass behavior in the BM Gras Buitentalud model, thereby 
improving simulations of erosion under drought conditions. Additionally, further clay erosion 
experiments are essential to deepen our understanding of drought effects on clay layers and to 
strengthen the empirical basis for modeling their behavior.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Stam, E.B. van",July 2025,English,"No

by monitoring and analyzing their structural responses over time. One of the methods of
damage detection is the vibration based approach. It relies on changes in modal parameters, which occur in the event of damage introduction. But modal parameters can also
be affected by environmental factors. This thesis investigates the impact of certain temperature gradient assumptions on the reliability of vibration based damage detection.
A Finite Element Model (FEM) of a simply supported HE 200B steel girder was subject to a coupled-field analysis which involved a pre-stressed modal analysis given the
results of a transient thermal analysis. Two thermal loading scenarios were investigated:
spring and winter. They involved hourly data on sun irradiance and ambient temperature, for two separate days. The study compared the effects of the realistic temperature
distributions with those of a uniform temperature on the frequencies of the first three
modes of the girder. Lastly, damage was introduced to evaluate whether its effects on
dynamics are more or less pronounced than those of temperature.
The results show that the assumption that the girder has the same temperature as the
ambient introduces error in modal frequency computing, especially for mode 1 (lateral)
and mode 2 (torsional). Meanwhile, mode 3 (vertical) remained insensitive to them. But
the relative errors followed the same pattern as the ambient temperature. When structural damage was introduced, the thermal effects either masked or exacerbated its effects

107870,"The Role of Self-connectedness, Connectedness to Others, and Connectedness to the World in the Recovery from PTSD: A Systematic Literature Review",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107870,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complicated psychological response to experiencing or observing traumatic events. Connectedness may play a key role in PTSD recovery by fostering acceptance and a sense of purpose, which support emotional regulation and positive coping strategies. Connectedness includes three dimensions: connectedness to self, to others, and to the world. In this systematic literature search was conducted examining the role of the dimension of connectedness on PTSD recovery through the analysis of six peer-reviewed publications from Scopus, PsychINFO, and Web of Science databases.
	The included studies focused on diverse populations, such as women with experiences of sexual violence, individuals affected by natural and man-made disasters, military veterans with trauma related to deployment, and people living with severe mental health conditions. These studies utilised various research methods, including qualitative techniques and cross-sectional study designs.
	Despite the small number of studies, the findings indicate that all three types of connectedness may contribute to recovery from PTSD. Higher levels of connectedness to self, connectedness to others, and connectedness to the world were linked to improved emotional processing, resilience, and psychological growth. These results provide an important initial insight into how connectedness might aid recovery from trauma. However, due to the limited and varied nature of the existing evidence, conclusions should be made cautiously.

107869,Application of agentic AI systems in nature-inclusive multidisciplinary flood defense design,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107869,"This thesis investigates the use of artificial intelligence ( AI) systems for the integration of nature-based solutions (NbS) into river dike design in the Netherlands. The developed multi-agent 
system consists of six specialized agents, each with distinct tasks and roles in the design and 
assessment process. The system goes from selected NbS to the assessment and comparison of 
the solutions in contrast to a conventional river dike autonomously. This is done by a safety 
analysis using EurOtop overtopping method, iteration to dike height and slope based on 
selected NbS, and a weighted multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to evaluate solutions 
across technical, ecological, and socio-economic criteria. 
A key aspect of the methodology is the use of the Integrated Green-Grey Infrastructure (IGGI) 
framework, which guides the classification and selection of NbS for the scenario analysis. The 
model was tested for a case scenario on the Grebbedijk section 3D, a scenario representing 
generic Dutch river dikes. Where one NbS from each IGGI category is selected for a 
comprehensive comparison to the conventional river dike baseline.
Results show that most NbS options led to reduction in required dike height (3 to 10.6%) and 
promoted more gradual slopes, which can enhance both biodiversity and climate resilience. The 
MCDA revealed that greener solutions typically outperformed the conventional dike in criteria
such as flood resilience, biodiversity, and social acceptance, regardless of whether a conservative 
or environmental perspective was used. However, the analysis showed that the final rankings of 
the solutions were sensitive to the quality and keyword density present in the AI generated 
summaries.
Expert elicitation confirmed that the system’s outputs were reasonable and aligned with 
environmental and hydrological knowledge. Yet, further development , such as addition of more 
failure mechanisms and the economic valuation of NbS benefits would strengthen the systems 
analysis.
This research demonstrates that agentic AI can facilitate the inclusion of nature-based solutions

107868,Climate adaptive outdoor space measures dealing with waterlogging,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107868,"With ongoing climate change, urban areas in the Netherlands increasingly face extreme precipitation 
events that cause waterlogging. To mitigate these impacts, municipalities must implement adaptation 
measures. This research aims to identify the most suitable measures for Dutch urban areas to mitigate 
the impacts of extreme precipitation. D-Hydro, a simulation model, was used to assess the performance 
of the measures for a case study in Duiven for an 80mm/hr rainfall event. First, a literature study and 
expert consultation provided an overview of existing adaption measures, their benefits and limitations. 
Secondly, assessment criteria and modelling methods were determined through literature and expert
consultations. Thirdly, seven measures were simulated for the case study: de-paving, ditches, 
infiltration crates, green roofs, permeable paving, sewer improvement and wadis. These were 
evaluated based on: water depth on the road, time until roads are accessible, total infiltration, water 
flow towards the nearby neighbourhood, water level rise in the nearby waterway, costs and space. 
Results showed that wadis performed best overall, but require a high investment and a large area. 
Ditches also performed well on most criteria and are also cost- and space-effective. Permeable paving 
and de-paving are cost-effective measures, but are less effective in enhancing the infiltration. Due to 
required technologies, infiltration crates, sewer improvement and green roofs have relatively high costs 
but do not require outdoor space. From this, it was concluded that no single measure is the best option 
in every situation and that the suitability and effectiveness of a measure is highly dependent on location 
specific characteristics and the client’s priorities. Nevertheless, the qualitative scores and the 
simulation provide a first insight into the possibilities and considerations for each adaptation measure.

be implemented.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Geertman, S.T",July 2025,English,"No

At Radboudumc’s surgical clinic, persistent structural bed vacancy exists despite high overall demand, pointing to inefficiencies in capacity organisation. This study investigates strategic redesign options to reduce bed vacancy while improving patient flow and staff experience. A five-step research approach was used, combining root cause analysis, literature review, empirical diagnostics, simulation, and strategic evaluation. Two systemic issues were identified: fragmented care organisation and supply-driven steering. Although planning tools exist, they are inconsistently used in daily operations. Empirical analysis and queuing models revealed that weekday peak strain could be mitigated using two redesigns: pooling acute patients in a central Acute Pooling Unit (APU) and introducing a dynamic buffer zone between departments. A 5–15 bed buffer reduced P85 occupancy without requiring more beds. However, smoothing elective schedules proved more effective than buffering alone. The study concludes that capacity efficiency can be improved through better timing of bed activation, elective admission smoothing, and predictive steering. This thesis contributes a design-oriented approach to strategic hospital planning, integrating empirical diagnostics and queuing theory to reveal mismatches that inform sustainable, system-wide improvements.

flow of gases and liquids in pipes, tubing and other areas where
gas or fluid flow needs to be controlled. The general problem is
that the heat transfer that these sensors rely on is dependent on
the flow medium. Besides the flow and applied power, the thermal
conductivity and volumetric heat capacity of the gasses determine
the temperature offset. A flow independent method needs to be

on the fly. Typically for thermal flow sensors the 3ω method is
used for this. A new sensor is developed that differentiates itself
by also being able to measure the direction of the flow. This
thesis investigates the possibility of measuring the volumetric heat
capacity of gasses in this newly developed thermal flow sensor by

Accurate characterization of these switching losses is crucial for optimizing power inverter performance, reducing energy usage, and guiding thermal design. This thesis presents a comprehensive investigation of the switching behavior of WBG devices through the implementation of the Double Pulse Test (DPT), a widely accepted method for dynamic characterization. A complete test setup was simulated with a gate driver circuit. The variation in voltage, current, inductor value and gate resistor analyzed throughout the simulations.

This study evaluated the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) acquired thermal infrared (TIR) data to improve the predictability of canopy biochemical properties—specifically canopy water (CWC), chlorophyll (CCC), and nitrogen content (CNC) — for the Calabrian pine (Pinus brutia). Field campaigns were conducted at two sites in Lefka Ori, Crete, during which multispectral (MS) and TIR data were collected, the latter both in the morning (am) and afternoon (pm). Canopy surface temperature (CST) metrics and TIR-derived vegetation indices (VIs) were extracted and analysed alongside field- and laboratory-measured canopy biochemical properties. Simple linear regression (SLR) revealed that little explanatory power existed between TIR-derived variables and biochemical properties, potentially reflecting a physiological delay, between stomatal closure and chlorophyll response extending to nitrogen. However, a significant, negative relationship was found between CST-pm and CCC (R² = 0.097, p = 0.040) in addition to the Vegetation Water Supply Index (VWSI) which overall exhibited negative, significant correlations among the three canopy properties for both VWSI-am and VWSI-pm. Nonetheless, all R² values remained below 0.2, highlighting limited explanatory power. The machine learning (ML) models Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were applied to assess whether the inclusion of TIR data enhanced prediction accuracy of CWC, CCC, and CNC when integrated with MS-based models. Initial best-performing baseline models were established through recursive feature elimination (RFE) and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) using MS data, after which TIR data were introduced to the models. The inclusion of TIR features degraded model performance across all sites and biochemical properties, particularly severe in the case of am TIR data. In general, less performance loss was observed when adding CST-pm and VWSI-pm to the models, indicating that the timing of TIR data acquisition influences model performance. RF models were initially more accurate than SVM models, but proved more susceptible to performance decline, while SVM models performed worse, however, more stable. The model increase in RMSE ranged from 6.44 to 26.44 % for CWC, from 4.55 to 33.93 % for CCC, and from 3.53 to17.63 % for CNC across ML models and sites.

It addresses a gap in existing models, such as TRL and HRL (Technology and Human Readiness Levels), which often overlook organisational and human factors. SRL introduces a stakeholder-focused perspective to technology adoption. The framework was developed through a synthesis of existing literature and validated empirically through qualitative interviews with GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) professionals and non-experts across four countries. Thematic analysis and the Gioia method confirmed the framework’s relevance and showed that readiness is shaped by both personal and institutional dynamics. The six proposed SRL dimensions (Awareness, Trust, Engagement, Competence, Support Structures, and Ownership) were further validated through the interviews. The empirical findings revealed three narrower readiness themes: Strategic and Cultural Alignment, Participatory Governance, and Organisational Support Systems. These illustrate how readiness factors cluster and interact from a practical perspective. The proposed framework can function as both a diagnostic instrument and a strategic guide for facilitating inclusive, sustainable, and contextually appropriate technology adoption processes within organisations.",Bachelor Business Information Technology (B-BIT),"Filip, Maria-Bianca",July 2025,English,"No

While wearable devices and fitness applications can help motivate by providing performance metrics, their feedback is often generic and lacks personal relevance. This study aims to address this gap by exploring the integration of psychological data, such as the user’s mood, with performance metrics to deliver personalised, AI-generated feedback tailored to casual runners. Despite advancements in AI and wearable technology, current sports feedback systems rarely utilise psychological factors in their design. This exclusion of psychological data limits these feedback systems from providing meaningful and motivational insights. By combining mood-based input with performance data and AI-generative feedback, this study displays the potential for a more motivating and personalised feedback system. The developed prototype, tested with casual runners, highlights the feasibility of integrating psychological data into AI-driven feedback systems. The findings suggest that this approach of providing feedback not only motivates but also opens opportunities for innovation in fitness and sports technology.",Bachelor Creative Technology (B-CREA),"Vafi, A.J.",July 2025,English,"No

107849,Hybrid phenological modelling for enhancing plant phenology prediction,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107849,"Accurate phenological forecasting is vital for ecological monitoring, climate adaptation, and agricultural decision-making. Common modelling approaches, which include Process-Based Models (PBMs) and Machine Learning (ML), offer contrasting strengths: PBMs provide biological interpretability but struggle with ecological complexity and transferability, while ML models are data-driven and adaptable but often lack physiological transparency. This study investigated two hybrid phenology modelling strategies for predicting budburst dates under climate variability. The first strategy applied an ML-derived parameterization of the UNIFORC Process-Based Model, dynamically estimating site- and year-specific parameters. The second combined multiple fixed-parameter UNIFORC variants and machine learning regressors using a linear ensemble metamodel. Both approaches were evaluated over a 15-year period (2001–2015) using a year-forward chaining strategy and windowed climate data. The ML-derived parameterization was found to produce ecologically meaningful parameter dynamics, such as plausible interannual shifts in the thermal forcing threshold (f_crit ranging from ~41 to 48) and forcing onset (t0 ranging from DOY 25 to 29), while maintaining relatively consistent predictive accuracy (mean RMSE = 8.70, MAE = 6.99). In contrast, the ensemble model achieved comparable overall performance (mean RMSE = 8.17, MAE = 6.93), but exhibited a pronounced Regression-to-the-mean effect, evidenced by a lower slope (0.08) and R² (0.02) in observed vs. predicted plots. This study concluded that while both models offer predictive value, the ML-derived parameterization provides superior interpretability and biological transparency, making it more suitable for applications requiring ecological insight and climate adaptability.

US foreign policy under these administrations reflects elements of soft or hard Euroscepticism. The
research design adopts a qualitative content analysis in which political rhetoric and policy are evaluated

Taggart and Szczerbiak, as well as theoretical perspectives from international relations.
This study is significant for the understanding of transatlantic relations at a time of increasing
geopolitical tensions. By identifying patterns of Eurosceptic rhetoric and policy change, the study
reveals that the behaviour of the Trump and Biden administrations can be identified with the
international relations theories of realism and liberalism, leading to the result that the US is getting more
Eurosceptic under the Trump administration due to realist and constructivist arguments.

In decentralized settings, however, scheduling decisions are typically made under incomplete knowledge of the overall system, making it difficult to anticipate delays and coordinate behavior. This paper proposes a method that integrates predictive process mining into decentralized AGV scheduling. The approach makes use of lightweight regression models, trained on event log data per AGV. Predictions are used to reject delay-prone assignments at the local level proactively. A simulation framework models task dynamics in a warehouse layout, generating synthetic logs for training and evaluation. We compare predictive and non-predictive variants across three decentralized scheduling strategies, using key performance indicators such as delay rate, throughput, makespan, and AGV utilization. Results show trade-offs between task-centric and AGV-centric heuristics, and highlight future opportunities for improving prediction quality and system responsiveness through richer features and adaptive mechanisms.",Bachelor Technical Computer Science (B-TCS),"Fernández Castillo, Rodrigo",July 2025,English,"Yes.

107844,"Predicting Trait Anxiety Through Within-Person Means, Fluctuations, and Inertia in Momentary Anxiety : An Experience Sampling Study",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107844,"Traditionally, anxiety has been conceptualised and measured as a stable individual trait, yet current research suggests that it may be rooted in dynamic emotional processes experienced in daily life. Although prior research has already found a connection between general affective states and trait anxiety, less is known about the influence of anxiety-specific dynamics on trait anxiety. Thus, this study aimed to explore the association between within-person mean levels, fluctuations and inertia of state measures of anxiety and trait anxiety. This study used previously collected data with the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) from 26 non-clinical participants who were assessed four times a day for one week, measuring state anxiety. Trait anxiety was measured via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) on the eighth day. Individual metrics were computed for mean levels (person-means; PM), fluctuations (root mean square of successive differences; RMSSD), and inertia (autocorrelation function; ACF). Visualisations of scatterplots, facet time series and bar charts showed that individuals with high trait anxiety tended to show higher levels of both mean state anxiety and fluctuations. A significant effect of person-mean levels (β = .53, p = .005) and fluctuations of state anxiety (β = .56, p = .005) on trait anxiety was found in univariate analysis. In the multivariate model with the three predictors, neither person-mean levels (β = .09, p = .17) nor fluctuations (β = .18, p = .116) remained significant after being included, suggesting shared variance among these predictors (r = .63, p < .001). In both univariate and multivariate models, there was no significant association between inertia and trait anxiety. The present study adds to the understanding of anxiety disorders by emphasising the influence of state anxiety dynamics on trait anxiety, particularly mean levels and fluctuations. The findings highlight the need for further investigation into these dynamics among the clinical population.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Mania, C.R.",July 2025,English,"No

107843,Revealing the margins : Towards ex vivo image-guided surgery in oral cancer resection : Facilitating intraoperative assessment of resection margins during oral squamous cell carcinoma surgery using automatic segmentation and 3D visualisation on ex vivo 7 tesla magnetic resonance imaging.,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107843,"Rationale
The 7Tex study at the UMC Utrecht aims to enable intraoperative assessment of resection margins (IOARM) during oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) surgery within 45 minutes, using 7 tesla magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to reduce the incidence of inadequate margins. To facilitate this, an automatic pipeline for tumour segmentation and intuitive resection margin visualisation is required.
Methods
55 transverse and 47 sagittal T2-weighted (T2w) MR scans of resection specimens were used to train deep-learning networks for automatic segmentation of tumour tissue. The generation of an intuitive, three-dimensional (3D) resection margin visualisation model was achieved using Python scripting in dedicated imaging software. This 3D model was evaluated by all surgeons performing OSCC resections at the UMC Utrecht using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Feasibility of super-resolution algorithms was explored by reconstructing coronal T2w scans using only the transverse and sagittal T2w scans.
Results
The networks achieved Dice similarity coefficient scores of 0.695 ± 0.231 (transverse) and 0.698 ± 0.164 (sagittal). The 3D model could be generated within five minutes of the specimen scan and tumour segmentation being provided. Usability of the 3D model was positively evaluated by all surgeons, with an average SUS score of 74.4. Super-resolution reconstruction returned an average structural similarity index measure of 0.766 ± 0.0842 and a root mean squared error of 4.16% ± 1.54 relative to total signal intensity.
Conclusion
This study presents a clinical pipeline which facilitates IOARM in OSCC surgery, combining automatic tumour segmentation and intuitive 3D visualisation of ex vivo 7T MR scans. While some logistical challenges remain to be addressed, the technical foundation for clinical implementation of the pipeline is now established.",Master Technical Medicine (M-TM),"Versteeg, Guus",July 2025,English,"No.

Framed by three interrelated research streams—technology, education, and psychological research factors (motivation, engagement, and performance)—the study applies a comparative approach to assess differences in perceptions between 169 students and 31 educators. A questionnaire grounded in validated constructs measured intrinsic motivation using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), extrinsic motivation using the Academic Motivation Scale (AMS), engagement (based on the Technology Acceptance Model), and perceived academic performance (from the Expectancy-Value Theory). Descriptive statistics and inferential tests (t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests) revealed largely similar, moderately positive attitudes across both groups. Students reported higher enjoyment and intention to use VR, while educators perceived greater usefulness and expected stronger learning outcomes. Only the expectancy construct showed a statistically significant difference, with educators expressing greater belief in VR’s academic benefits. These findings suggest that while VR is broadly accepted across roles, key motivational and practical distinctions exist. The discussion integrates recent academic literature to reflect these patterns, highlighting implications for the educational field, VR implementation strategies, and the broader discourse on digital transformation in higher education.

Conventional treatment methods are often ineffective and cause severe side effects.
This research investigates the MR compatibility of a novel subcutaneous neurostimulation device designed to relieve the symptomology of (chronic) migraine. Its unique characteristics with respect to other neurostimulators raises interest and need for a dedicated evaluation of its safety within an MRI environment (mainly 1.5T). The ISO/TS 10974:2018 on the MR compatibility of Active Implantable Medical Devices (AIMD) provided a framework for the experimental setup including the evaluation of translational force, torque and demagnetisation induced by the static magnetic field (B_0), RF- and gradient induced heating, functionality of the AIMD after exposure to the electromagnetic fields of an MRI and an assessment of the induced image artifacts. 
Results have shown that the AIMD experienced reasonable translational forces (max. 1 N) and substantial torque (max. 0.068 Nm). No demagnetisation was found for 1.5T systems. 3.0T and 7.0T systems resulted in significant orientational dependent demagnetisation (>100%). The simulated RF induced heating amounted to max. ±2.3 W/kg with hotspots localized near the eighth electrode of the lead. Experimentally, a temperature increase of max. 1.28 °C was found. Gradient induced heating was not observed. None of the experiments caused dysfunctionality of the AIMD.
	These findings seem to offer a good perspective for MR compatibility labelling in 1.5T systems. However, the torque can potentially be problematic and lead to dislocation or rotation of the internal magnet or the AIMD. The max. RF-induced heating is also not compliant with the safety limit. However, this is a conservative analysis which means less significant heating may occur in practice. In addition, a CEM43 analysis showed that the risk of tissue damage due to heating is minimal.",Master Biomedical Engineering (M-BME),"Geurink, Bas",July 2025,English,"No.

107832,Urban microclimate assessment at block-scale in Dutch cities,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107832,"Climate change and the densification of cities due to urbanisation are intensifying thermal stress globally, including temperate regions like the Netherlands. With about 70% of the global population residing in urban areas by 2050, conventional approaches to urban climate research lack the finer insights needed to adapt to these changes. Urban climate research increasingly relies on climate-based classifications like local climate zones (LCZ), but these approaches fail to capture micro-scale heterogeneity, such as rapid temporal variability and subtle interactions between surface and canopy layers, creating a critical knowledge gap. An alternative is to conduct the urban microclimate (UMC) analysis at the scale of urban blocks, which is even finer than the LCZ and provides a practical scale to integrate the learning in the planning processes of the urban areas. Adopting a multi‐city approach, this study investigates the spatial and temporal dynamics of UMC at the block scale in two Dutch cities, Amsterdam and Utrecht, to assess how physical characteristics of urban blocks influence thermal comfort during peak summer conditions. By examining two cities, the study evaluates whether consistent UMC responses to block morphology emerge across varied urban fabrics. More than 10000 urban blocks were delineated using cadastral and transport datasets and classified into 10 distinct morpho-landscape clusters in both cities using metrics related to surface cover and urban form. Air temperature (AT) and relative humidity (RH) data were collected at hourly intervals from citizen weather stations (CWS) and filtered for quality control. Using CWS data, hourly temporal patterns (AT and RH) were analysed for the classified block clusters in the study areas. Outdoor thermal comfort was assessed via the Humidex, and zones of influence around each CWS (200 m buffers) were defined to link atmospheric data to local UMC regimes. The results show substantial diurnal variation in microclimate between and within block clusters. The open, high thermal mass, high-SVF blocks exhibited rapid heating after sunrise, peaking near 33 °C in mid-afternoon, accompanied by slower nocturnal cooling, whereas compact, mid-rise, moderate-SVF blocks remained up to 3 °C cooler during peak hours and released heat more rapidly after sunset due to decreased solar access and shaded urban canyons facilitating moisture-retaining conditions. Random Forest models explained over 80% of the variation in Humidex across the day, and feature importance analysis confirmed that landscape configuration, not just the presence of green and blue spaces, drives thermal patterns. This study demonstrates that block-scale UMC assessment provides a more actionable understanding of urban thermal dynamics than coarser-scale studies. The findings offer thresholds and types that can be integrated into urban planning for heat mitigation, supporting a shift from traditional top-down efforts to bottom-up, form and landscape-based planning interventions for Dutch cities facing future densification pressures. The methods developed have potential to be transferable to other temperate urban contexts by integrating feature-based and variable-based clustering methods in UMC assessments and the results highlight the value of UMC responsive planning at the block scale.",Master Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (M-GEO-WO),"Gupta, A.C.",July 2025,English,"No.

Perceived and objective access scores were computed across the five dimensions, and mismatch scores were derived at individual and community levels. Results reveal that mismatch is widespread but uneven: affordability and accommodation were commonly overestimated, particularly among older and low-income groups, while availability was often underestimated in low-capacity areas. Bypass behaviour was prevalent (89.5%) and not always linked to facility functional limitation, suggesting that expectations, dissatisfaction, and perceived inconvenience play a role in healthcare decision-making.

107828,A Workflow For Synchronizing FAIR Data Points With Git Repositories,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107828,"The FAIR principles: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability have increased in relevance over the past few years, and one of their main
use is to promote data-driven scientific research. Solutions such as FAIR Data
Points (FDPs) have been proposed to support projects in adhering to these
principles through the publication of metadata about currently published
digital objects and datasets. However, FDPs focus only on metadata and do
not store or archive data itself. Today, many scientific communities adopt
online Git-based options as a solution for the publication of scientific resources because of a number of advantages such as easier collaboration, file
versioning, and reliable availability. This paper aims to explore a combination of Git-based solutions and FDPs as an architecture that has the purpose
of promoting, sharing, and reusing scientific data, where Git serves as a
data storage solution, and FDP serves as a metadata storage and discovery
solution. To achieve this, we discuss the challenges involved in synchronizing the components of this architecture and the limitations of each of
these components. Then, we propose an architecture with FDP and Git as
synchronized components. Furthermore, we demonstrate the viability of this
solution by developing a synchronization script that supports an existing

While such innovations promise more efficient and personalized care, organizations often face challenges in implementation, including technological complexity, limited staff readiness, organisational barriers, and the sensitive, relational nature of (in)continence care. Using qualitative methods—semi-structured interviews and focus groups with care staff, managers, and stakeholders, the study applied the IST–SOLL gap analysis and the Measurement Instrument for Determinants of Innovations (MIDI) framework. Findings revealed key barriers: lack of workflow integration, unclear roles, insufficient training, and concerns over client dignity. Facilitators included stepwise implementation, clear communication, staff involvement, and ethical reflection in training. The study concludes that successful implementation depends not only on the functionality of the technology but also on aligning innovations with the values, routines, and emotional dimensions of care work. A policy framework should support iterative implementation, ethical sensitivity, team collaboration, and long-term evaluation.

Social marketing is a powerful tool to combat overconsumption by influencing individuals behavior through communication appeals. This research targets specific emotions like joy, pride and love may lead to effective campaigns to combat overconsumption.
Objectives: this study investigates the extent to which different emotional social marketing communication appeals influence brand image and purchase intention in the fast-fashion industry, with consumer environmental concern as a potential moderating variable.
Literature review: research showed that positive emotional appeals (e.g., joy, pride and love) are effective in influencing purchase intention and brand image. In addition, it is expected that abstract appeals reduce more effectively overconsumption than concrete appeals and emotional appeals are more effective for individuals with low environmental concerns.
Methods: a quantitative, survey-based experimental design assigned 301 adults living in the Netherlands to view one of eight advertisements featuring joy, pride, love or neutral appeal in abstract or concrete format.
Conclusion: the study revealed no significant effects of emotional appeal or message specificity on brand image or purchase intention, based on 301 responses. Environmental concern did not moderate these relationships, but highly concerned individuals showed stronger brand evaluation and intent to lower consumption.

European Union (EU). This thesis investigates how the metaphor of Fortress Europe (FE) is constructed through the EU Smart Borders Package (SBP). It poses the assumption that the narrative surrounding the EU SBP contributes to the symbolic construction of Fortress Europe by framing borders as sites of securitization, technological control, and exclusion. The research question central to this thesis is: “How is the metaphor of Fortress Europe constructed through the EU Smart Borders Package narrative?” . This study performs a qualitative content analysis of five document types – EU documents, academic articles, NGO reports, media articles, and book chapters – utilizing ATLAS.ti. Drawing on Foucault’s Theory of Biopolitics and extended theories, Agamben’s Homo Sacer and Mbembe’s Necropolitics, this research finds that the EU SBP transforms FE from a territorial concept into an invisible, algorithmic system of surveillance and exclusion. Framed by the EU as efficient and protective, critical actors such as NGOs, scholars, and the media critique the SBP as biopolitical – and necropolitical – tools that reinforce systematic inequality and marginalization. The metaphor of FE is both confirmed and contested by institutions, turning the SBP into a site of symbolic and political controversy regarding the meaning and legitimacy of borders.","Bachelor Management, Society and Technology (B-MST)","Kolsteeg, M.K.",July 2025,English,"No

107818,Predicting customer churn in a liberalized energy market : A Machine Learning and Explainable AI approach,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107818,"In liberalized energy markets such as the Netherlands, where all consumers receive energy through a centralized infrastructure, suppliers face high competition not on product quality but on pricing, service, and customer experience. This dynamic leads to high customer churn rates, causing significant financial challenges for energy providers. This thesis investigates how Machine Learning (ML) and Explainable AI (XAI) can be used to proactively reduce customer churn within such markets. Using the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM), a structured process was developed and validated through a real-world case study involving customer data from a Dutch energy supplier. The resulting artifact includes a churn prediction model, with XGBoost performing most effectively, combined with XAI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to improve interpretability. These predictive insights were incorporated into a six-step Proactive Churn Retention Process (PCRP), which enables energy suppliers to integrate customer churn prediction into their internal processes and customer retention strategies. Expert validations confirmed the practical relevance and feasibility of the proposed approach. This thesis contributes both a predictive model and a business-oriented framework that bridges the gap between technical insight and strategic application. Customer churn prediction serves as a valuable step toward better understanding customer behavior, allowing companies to deliver a better customer experience. While the research is limited by data scope and evaluation scale, it offers a solid foundation for future work in data-driven customer retention.

107817,Automatic delineation of small agriculture fields in vector  geometries from satellite images using transformer-based deep learning networks,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107817,"Precise delineation of smallholder farm fields from satellite imagery remains challenging due to irregular 
shapes and subtle, fragmented boundaries. This thesis presents a transformer-based deep learning model 
adapted from the RoomFormer architecture to directly predict agricultural field boundaries as closed vector 
polygons. By integrating a memory-optimized local-global attention mechanism (inspired by PolyRoom) 
into RoomFormer, the model efficiently handles the dense and irregular geometries of small fields without the O(MN)
2 memory cost of global attention, where M is the maximum number of polygons (fields) per 
image and N is the maximum number of vertices per polygon. The approach was trained and evaluated on 
the AI4SmallFarms dataset of smallholder fields in Cambodia and Vietnam, enabling polygon outputs that 
maintain topological consistency (shared boundaries and no gaps) across densely packed fields. Unlike 
conventional raster-to-vector pipelines, the proposed model outputs field polygons end-to-end, eliminating 
post-processing steps. Evaluation results demonstrate a significant improvement in boundary accuracy: the 
model achieved an average PoLiS (polygon spatial error) of 7.7 m, a >60% reduction compared to the 20 m 
baseline. It attained a competitive F1-score (0.52 versus 0.59 for the baseline) despite a slightly lower recall, 
indicating a trade-off favouring precise delineation. These findings highlight the advantages of a polygon-based transformer network for mapping small agricultural parcels, offering improved geometric fidelity and 
a scalable solution for smallholder farm delineation in support of land and agricultural resources 
management.

Addressing the gap left by existing sports analytics tools that do not feed insights back into autonomous simulations, this data-driven approach employs a closed-loop structure inspired by CRISP-DM, Gaia, KDD, and Prometheus. In this framework, event logs generated by a multi-agent football simulator are repeatedly analysed using process mining—specifically as a verification tool—while tactical inefficiencies are primarily identified through detailed KPI analysis. Verified insights are then manually incorporated into agent decision logic, allowing for continuous refinement and measurable improvement in team
performance. Across six iterative cycles, the method led to tactical gains, with the home team’s results improving from 2 wins and a –23 goal difference at baseline to 28 wins and a +104 goal difference, while process mining confirmed the emergence of more effective tactical patterns. The results,

to be made to preserve them. Luckily, this is happening through the placement of bat boxes.
However, it is not always known if bat boxes are being used, when this is known, it can
provide an insight into bat populations and the overall ecosystem health. Therefore, this
graduation project used an iterative process to develop a bat presence monitoring device.
A literature review was conducted to identify and evaluate existing bat monitoring
methods. Experts were interviewed to determine design requirements. In combination with
the background research, MoSCoW requirements were developed. Based on a decision
matrix, the two most suitable sensors were picked. The RCWL-0516 microwave radar
sensor and the MPR121 capacitive sensor. Using these two sensors, multiple prototypes
were developed. The radar was shielded to reduce outside influence and direct the
microwaves to the desired sensing area. In the case of the capacitive sensor strips of
different lengths and materials were created. Moreover, the sensor sensitivity was tweaked.
These prototypes were evaluated using rabbits. Eight different prototypes were each
evaluated in two separate tests.
The shielded RCWL-0516 scored the highest with an F1 score of 0.77, closely
followed by the MPR121 capacitive sensor with a score of 0.72. Despite the radar sensor
scoring higher, the capacitive sensor was picked for the development of the final system.
This was due to the greater practicality and versatility the MPR121 offered over the
RCWL-0516. When using the shielded radar, the entire bat box needs to be covered in
reflective material. The capacitive sensor can be used on a variety of different entrances due
to the flexibility with which the copper strips can be placed. Using the MPR121, an affordable

This thesis, by the processof a qualitative content analysis of 24 official EU documents, policies, and conferences,all drawn from the time period between 2022 and 2025, shows that the EU’s discourse is stuck in a paradox. On one hand, the EU does recognize the main characteristics of the Metaverse, while also acknowledging that this novel space might amplify propaganda and emotional manipulation, leading to radicalization and a rise of extremism. On the other hand, the EU’s discourse regarding the issue is still very ambiguous, and a clear ,comprehensive, targeted policy framework towards the Metaverse is still missing. The EU can be found stuck between believing that outdated regulations might suffice, postponing the Metaverse as a future threat, having a reactive rather than a proactive approach,thus different then how it did with previous social media and internet frameworks. The contribution of this thesis towards the current scholarly and policy debates comes fromits emphasis, based on the findings, on the current need of the EU for a comprehensive, targeted, and future-oriented policy framework and overall approach towards the unique characteristics defining the Metaverse, and other virtual worlds.","Bachelor Management, Society and Technology (B-MST)","Ciobanu, Elena",June 2025,English,"No

The 3D GRFs are measured through force plates (the golden standard) in a controlled laboratory environment. However, the high cost and non-portability of force plates limit their use to labs, hindering GRF measurements in natural environments. To address this limitation, the Prometheus Insole was developed, a 3D printed sensor-integrated insole designed to estimate 3D GRF using System Identification (SID) models. Although previous results showed good performance, it still relied on the force plates to train subject-specific models. This study aims to make the insole self-sufficient in estimating 3D GRF with good accuracy. The study consists of two phases. First, a generalization phase, where SID models were built using walking data to achieve a generalized model that estimates walking 3D GRF across individuals. Second, a calibration phase, where a protocol is designed to fine-tune the generalized model to fit the target-subject characteristics, enhancing the model performance. The results showed that the generalized model can approximate the 3D GRF across new subjects with moderate accuracy (RMSE = 10~20%, R^2 = 0.5~0.7). The designed calibration method showed improvement in the model performance, however, only for the vertical GRF component.

Conventional flood management strategies have proved inadequate in addressing recurrent and severe flooding in the region. This study investigates the effectiveness and practicality of implementing Nature-based Solutions (NbS) for flood risk management in South Tongu District, Ghana. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research integrates spatial analysis, hydrological modelling via the fast flood model, and expert interviews to assess flood-prone areas, evaluate selected NbS interventions, and examine implementation feasibility.
Three NbS, permeable surfaces, river restoration, and riparian/forested buffers, were selected based on literature review and local applicability. The fast flood model was used to simulate baseline and intervention scenarios. Results indicate that all three measures reduced flood extent, depth and affected buildings, with river restoration showing the most significant reduction. Permeable surfaces were most effective in built-up areas, while riparian buffers contributed to reduced runoff and erosion along riverbanks.
Expert interviews revealed key practical challenges, including high initial costs, limited stakeholder awareness, and weak institutional coordination. Nonetheless, local soil conditions and vegetation support the feasibility of NbS integration, provided site-specific adaptations are made. The study concludes that NbS offer a viable and sustainable alternative to traditional flood management approaches in rural Ghana.

To implement clean cooking using electricity-powered methods, reliable and stable access to electricity is required. However, when power is scarce, proper management of load distribution and peak demand strategies becomes crucial. This research proposes a power-spreading system composed of 2 main components: a power-limiting circuit and a controller. The system is designed to manage the distribution of power to 4 low-power Electric Pressure Cookers (EPCs) using 3 distinct power-spreading algorithms and a limited power supply. The power-limiting circuit was tested in 2 configurations: a redesigned
 Printed Circuit Board (PCB) with a push-pull driver, bootstrap circuit, and a buck converter; and a half-bridge module configured as a non-synchronous buck converter. While the PCB setup effectively limits power, it was unable to deliver the required levels for cooking due to component limitations, as the MOSFET was significantly overheating. Nevertheless, the module-based configuration successfully limited and delivered enough power for cooking. However, efficiency needs to be improved because of significant power losses, and performance is compromised by the low switching frequency of the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal driving the MOSFET.

The central research question guiding this work is: ""What was the political uptake on EU-level regarding “Degrowth” following the Beyond Growth Conference 2023?"". To analyze how “Degrowth”-related ideas have been integrated, resisted, or framed in EU-level policymaking, this study draws on two complementary theoretical frameworks: The agenda setting theory (Kingdon, 1995) and the framing theory (Entman, 1993).  The empirical basis for the analysis consists of ten official documents by different EU bodies. A qualitative critical discourse analysis (CDA) was conducted using atlas.ti, with a coding scheme operationalizing both theories. The study seeks to identify both the extent of “Degrowth” uptake and the dominant policy and rhetorical frames in recent EU sustainability discourse. Ultimately, this research contributes to understanding to what extent transformative economic ideas like “Degrowth” gain traction in high-level political institutions and informs ongoing discussions about the future of sustainable policymaking in Europe.","Bachelor Management, Society and Technology (B-MST)","Fleischmann, Clemens Michael",June 2025,English,"No.

107805,From Awareness to Blame : Public Responses to Control in Sex Trafficking,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107805,"Public perceptions of human trafficking often focus on overt violence and captivity, overlooking the subtle and varied tactics used to control victims. This study explored public awareness of these methods, and how different control methods influence perceptions of victim blame. One hundred sixty-five participants were randomly assigned to read a vignette describing a trafficking scenario characterized by one of five control strategies. Participants then rated victim blame, perceived seriousness, and plausibility of the scenario. Moreover, participants answered an open-ended question about their prior knowledge of control methods. Findings showed that participants most commonly recognized psychological and physical control methods, while economic, legal, and relational control were rarely mentioned or less articulated. This suggests that public understanding is skewed towards more visible forms of coercion. Victim blaming attitudes did not significantly differ based on control methods alone. However, exploratory analyses revealed higher blame in response to economic and relational control scenarios compared to legal, physical, and psychological methods when accounting for individual differences such as gender, trafficking knowledge, and attitudes towards victims’ ability to leave. These findings underscore the complexity of victim blame, suggesting that public perceptions are influenced by both the nature of control and personal factors. The results highlight the need for improved public education on the diverse and often invisible mechanisms of trafficking control. Increasing awareness of non physical coercion may reduce harmful misconceptions, enhance victim identification, and foster more compassionate and supportive responses to survivors.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Hakala, P.M.",July 2025,English,"No.

This study evaluates the potential of integrating ultra-high resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data with medium resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to improve vegetation health classification in open pine forests in West Crete, Greece. Field-based measurements of tree health, based on defoliation and discoloration, were 
used to classify individual trees into health categories. Vegetation indices (VIs), including Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Normalised Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), were derived from UAV multispectral data at the object (tree) and plot levels and compared with corresponding indices from Sentinel-2 imagery. Statistical analysis revealed that SAVI was most effective at distinguishing between tree health classes at the object level, while GNDVI and NDRE showed limited spectral separability. At the plot level, GNDVI exhibited a strong correlation (R² = 0.82) between UAV and Sentinel-2 data, indicating its potential as a reliable proxy for UAV-derived assessments. Correlation analysis also highlighted improved alignment between UAV-derived and Sentinel-2 vegetation health indices after applying soil masking techniques (on Sentinel-2 data using an NDVI threshold) and integrating Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) from UAV data. This approach helped address mixed-pixel effects in Sentinel-2 imagery, particularly in open-canopy forests. 
The findings underscore the value of UAV data in validating and enhancing Sentinel–2–based vegetation health assessments. The study concludes that leveraging UAV-derived metrics, especially plot-level FVC, significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of forest health classification from satellite imagery.

Traditionally, these decisions were based on subjective opinions, such as the manager’s judgment and personal view of the game, which were unreliable. Recently, teams have increasingly turned to data-driven approaches to evaluate the performance of their tactics and players. These methods use historical data from the performances of both their players and those of their opponents to predict the most effective strategies for limiting the opposition’s strengths while executing the intended plan of the coach. This study compares different predictive models for optimizing team formations and starting lineups based on tactical plans and player profiles.

People with limited mobility are often overlooked in the design of Virtual Reality (VR) walking experiences, limiting inclusivity and accessibility. To address this, a seated VR walking experience was created, integrating a leg-based controller with a walking surface, accommodating the needs of partly ambulatory persons. The design process combined mind mapping, group brainstorming and a MoSCoW analysis to define requirements. The final prototype utilised ankle-mounted Vive Ultimate Trackers for leg tracking and a walking surface composed of a flexible PVC plate, chosen for its smooth sliding properties and natural walking feel. User tests were conducted with 14 fully ambulatory persons, comparing seated walking without and with the walking surface. The results showed strong statistical evidence (BF_10 = 163.456) that the walking surface improved usability, immersion, and comfort. All participants preferred seated walking with a walking surface, because it felt smoother and more natural. Data analysis showed that a walking surface provides more stability and coordination to the user. However, the walking patterns across the different individuals were less consistent than without the surface. The key limitation of the project was the user testing with a proxy group; no actual partly ambulatory persons took part in the tests. More limitations were the short duration of the user tests, potential biases because of the learning and the novelty effect, and the lack of comparison to other existing VR locomotion solutions. Further development should focus on making the walking surface adjustable to users' height, adding support for turning in real life, integrating the prototype into existing VR applications, and, most importantly, testing with partly ambulatory persons.",Bachelor Creative Technology (B-CREA),"Zoontjens, L.J.A.",July 2025,English,"No.

By training a Soft Actor–Critic agent on historical data from Zonneplan’s portfolio, the benchmark allows backcast comparison of trading outcomes without access to competitors’ results. Each day, the agent sequentially chooses hourly purchase volumes based on key state variables identified via exploratory analysis, aiming to minimize trading and imbalance costs. Two agent variants, with imbalance penalties of €1 000/MWh and €2 000/MWh, were evaluated against Zonneplan’s actual trades and hardcoded benchmarks. Although neither agent reduced total imbalance volume, both achieved substantial cost savings (57 % and 44 %, respectively) and lower cost‐volatility, indicating superior exploitation of market price dynamics. These results highlight the potential of RL to benchmark and improve day‐ahead trading strategies, demonstrating that deliberate forecasting deviations can cut costs without greatly sacrificing demand accuracy.

The UN identifies GBV as a global public health crisis, with one in three women affected. Research shows that incidents of GBV increase as climate change worsens, making it imperative to consider these issues as intersectional problem. Ecuador's high incidence of GBV and increased risk from climate change provide a critical case in which to evaluate the application of intersectionality in policy responses.
This paper evaluates how the Ecuadorian government acknowledges the connection between climate and gender policies. Primary data in the form of gender and environmental policies and legislation was
used alongside secondary data from reports and academic literature to contextualise the findings. A deductive approach was adopted, applying a coding scheme based on the theoretical framework. Qualitative content analysis (QCA) was employed to investigate whether the intersection of GBV and climate change is recognised within the policy framework. The findings reveal that the Ecuadorian government acknowledges this intersection and has implemented strategies to address the heightened vulnerabilities of women. Although intersectoral collaboration is encouraged, insufficient legal requirements mean that full cooperation is not guaranteed, resulting in a partially siloed governmental response.","Bachelor Management, Society and Technology (B-MST)","Köster, Ronja",June 2025,English,"No

The baseline of this study is the perspective, that access to healthcare is a human right based on different international agreements. Germany has also committed to multiple international legal frameworks that obligate healthcare access for everyone, but national laws remain different.
The analysis reveals that healthcare access in Germany is highly stratified, with different administrative implementations of the law leading to unequal conditions for migrants. Irregular migrants face further barriers due to a reporting obligation. In contrast, the compared countries provide at some points a more inclusive systems of access for migrants.

They report that these SDCs can no longer only be attributed to transient faults caused by particle strikes, but also to small delay faults (SDFs) caused by post-deployment ageing and marginal defects. Recently, the DelayAVF metric has been presented, which quantifies the vulnerability of a hardware structure to SDFs, alongside a simulation framework that can simulate the effects of SDFs in a hardware structure. The simulation framework is hindered by long simulation times and high computational demands. Using an FPGA, faster emulation and reduced computational overhead can be achieved. This thesis presents a tool that allows for emulation of SDFs at any point in a hardware structure by generating a delay at that point through the combination of path rerouting and IDELAY, a programmable tapped delay line. Key capabilities of this tool include dynamic control of the added delay duration and specific clock cycle for injection, and communication with a PC to manage the delay-injection flow.

A Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) is commonly used in health preference research, but citizens usually are limited involved in this method. Objective: This study investigates how citizens with rheumatoid arthritis engage with and experience their participation in conducting all steps of a Discrete Choice Experiment questionnaire for managing rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: Four co-researchers with RA participated in three online meetings. In the first meeting, co-researchers determined their roles and how to distribute the DCE-questionnaire. In the second meeting, they interpreted the analysed results and in the third meeting, they evaluated the co-working process. The qualitative data from meeting transcripts and reflection questionnaires were thematically analysed using the UK Standards for Public Involvement and the Involvement Matrix. Quantitative data from DCE-questionnaire responses were statistically analysed. Results: The co-researchers fulfilled different roles, from listener to partner. Their involvement increased the total number of responses and contributed to meaningful interpretations of the DCE results. They experienced the collaboration as meaningful, educational and equal.

107779,Combining Harmonic and Intermodulation Returns for Ranging with Dual-Mode Harmonic Radar,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107779,"Harmonic radars utilize non-linear tags to track small objects or organisms in cluttered environments. The non-linear tag returns a harmonic of the transmitted pulse, differentiating it from other reflections. Including one or more auxiliary single-tone transmitters with a different frequency can increase the detection range by enabling the tag to also generate a return at an intermodulation frequency. The novelty of this research lies in combining both returns into a single range estimate for increased ranging performance. An optimal receiver for combining returns and a less complex sub-optimal receiver were tested. Simulations showed both receivers performed about as well as or better than the best single return estimator.

107776,The Role of Frames in Shaping Public Attitudes Toward AI in the Public Safety Sector : An Experimental Study,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107776,"In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as ChatGPT, DeepL Translate and many others have rapidly gained significance in different sectors. The growing presence of such technologies highlights the increasing relevance and significance in our society. While these technologies offer many benefits, open questions, concerns, and possible fears are real issues. 
This research investigates how different framings of artificial intelligence influence the public perceptions of AI regarding acceptance and concerns in the public safety sector. To do so the study employs an experimental design, with random assignment to one of three framing conditions. The analysis is guided by the theory of the Technology Acceptance Model, the framing theory, and a framework on ethical guidelines regarding the use of AI. The findings indicate that framing significantly influences acceptance and concerns about AI. While positive framing increased acceptance and lowered concerns, negative framing decreased acceptance.

With the EU as the case, a single case study is applied trying to investigate the role of diversity of the member states in the EU and its potential to emulate foreign initiatives in the regard of environmental policy in order to stay competitive. In order to represent the diversity of the member states, a within case comparison with the countries Denmark, German and Poland is conducted.  To investigate dynamics in EU environmental policymaking, the theoretical frameworks of liberal intergovernmentalism and neo-functionalism are applied, representing two different approaches to European integration. Through the qualitative analysis of several official EU documents related to the Green Deal Industrial Plan and member state documents responding to these EU efforts, data is collected. The data analysis consisted of systematic coding, applying a predeveloped coding scheme along theoretical concepts of neo-functionalism and liberal intergovernmentalism. Observations from the findings revealed integration dynamics especially in regional contexts and country clusters, which confirmed liberal intergovernmentalist as well as neo-functionalist assumptions, suggesting a hybrid appearance of the theories. Benchmarking the level of ambition of EU environmental policy against the inflation reduction act, as one of the EUs main competitors in this field, the EU was found normatively ambitious, while underperforming in incentive based measures.

107764,Incorporating climate adaptation and energy transition into urban street redesign projects,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107764,"The company of bind notices that it is hard to take climate adaptation and energy transition into 
account in public space. This research is focused on projects on street level, as opposed to area 
development or individual buildings. Policies do not translate into project requirements and concrete 
measures sufficiently often, resulting in projects that are less future-proof. At the same time, the design 
process can become less efficient when incorporating more aspects. Therefore, this research tries to 
answer the following main question: How can climate adaptation and energy transition policies be 
better incorporated into project requirements and concrete measures in street redesign projects by 
bind?
This research starts with a literature review, followed by two semi-structured interviews with 
employees of bind. Subsequently, suggestions are made for four tools that bind could apply in the 
design process. Two of these tools are then further developed and tested. While writing the proposal 
for this research, it turned out the issue can be viewed as twofold: insufficient prioritization by 
municipalities and the methodology of engineering firms such as bind. The next two paragraphs will 
go into both perspectives. 
There is a large number of factors that cause climate adaptation and energy transition not to be 
prioritized by municipalities. One of the most important is capacity, both municipalities and utility 
companies have insufficient personnel capacity and expertise. Furthermore, financing is hard, 
especially as the incorporation of climate adaptation and energy transition measures often requires
budgets from various municipal departments. Additionally, there is still progress to be made in terms 
of awareness, motivating experts to think cross-sectoral. 
Challenges for bind are partly technical, such as lacking information about underground networks. A 
larger obstruction is the general inflexibility in the sector. Climate adaptation and energy transition 
measures are relatively new and have had little time to prove their value. Furthermore, goals often 
compete for the same space and (financial) means, which can make it harder to converge to a 
definitive design. Engineering firms such as bind try to streamline the design process as much as 
possible. 
Based on this problem analysis, a total of four tools was suggested, the first of which is a method for 
requirements analysis. This tool, an instrument based on Systems Engineering, is aimed on making the 
requirements from the client and stakeholders more explicit. It also serves as input for the second SE-tool: a contradiction matrix. Scores are awarded to the relation between requirements, ranging from 
supporting to contradictory. This should help to identify opposing requirements early on and help 
solve design conflicts. For the third tool, guidelines on climate adaptation measures were examined, 
resulting in a methodology that makes a suggestion for a global climate adaptation approach for a 
project design. Finally, a handbook was discovered which can be used to obtain linkage opportunities. 
Leading future-proof design choices can be looked up, which will result in a list of measures that 
probably could easily be implemented as well. Validation with the supervisor from bind showed that 
he thinks the tools are useful, besides some suggestions for improvements. 
Finally, as only two interviews at bind were carried out, applicability of the insights from this research 
might be limited for other companies. Therefore, the most important recommendation for further 
research would be to carry out similar research at other engineering firms.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Horst, P.J. van der",July 2025,English,"No

scheduled expansions, the pressure on the network increased, while the network becomes more vulnerable.
With the IJtram, the backbone of transit in the region, climbing to the critical, maximum frequency of
15 veh/h, the question raises whether the system will be future-proof and robust. In this study, an
alternative approach has been used, by investigating the effect of the addition of a higher-quality bus
service on the concurring position and robustness of the total transit network of the region.
According to survey results, inhabitants raise the most concerns about the crowding in, and reliability
of the existing transit system, while also mentioning the number of options in the region. A passenger
spread analysis shows that in future years, the demand towards the city centre, Amsterdam Zuid and
Amsterdam Noord increases the most in the upcoming years of development.
Considering the most important criteria of a higher-quality bus service, frequency, speed and comfort
are mentioned as the most important criteria. To make a transit network more appealing, literature
proves that the addition of a service will attract more passengers due to the increase of direct and
indirect destinations that become accessible. Frequency increase shows to have an effect on the behaviour
of passengers up to a certain value, after which the timetable becomes less important.
In this research, the effects of two conceptual designs have been tested in the Verkeersmodel Amsterdam. Both designs connect IJburg (first phase) with Amsterdam Zuid, with the first design including an
extra stop at Zeeburgereiland. Results show that the second conceptual design shows higher transport
values and better accessibility results. The addition of this line results in a travel time reduction to
Amsterdam Zuid, Amstelveen and Schiphol for the IJburg 1 region. No significant differences in modal
split have been noticed.
To analyse the robustness of the study, a simulation without the operation of the IJtram has been
performed. The results show that the addition of the second conceptual design has an impact on the
accessibility of and reduction of travel times to large parts in the centre, west and north of the city from

107760,Investigating the Role of 14-3-3 Proteins in Multiple Stages of Multimerization and Aggregation of α-Synuclein,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107760,"Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, is associated with the aggregation of
the intrinsically disordered protein α-synuclein (αS). A family of proteins known as 14-3-3
chaperones, which are part of the cellular protein quality control system, have shown an
inhibiting role in aggregation of αS. However, the way in which these chaperones interact
with αS remains poorly understood.
This study investigates both the early multimerization stages of α-synuclein and the later
fibrillar stages of αS aggregation, focusing on interactions with 14-3-3 at these different
stages. Using Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) measurements, this study demonstrates
that αS multimerizes in early stage through a cooperative mechanism. This study revealed
that electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds play a crucial role in early αS
multimerization. The τ , γ, and σ isoforms of 14-3-3 all affect this early αS multimerization,
overall resulting in a decrease in cooperativity. This may indicate the formation of
mixed multimers of αS and 14-3-3 through a non-cooperative process. These mixed multimers
do not form amyloid fibrils and compete with the formation of fibrils from αS-only
multimers. Using the techniques Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) and Fluorescence Correlation
Spectroscopy (FCS), indications for interaction between αS 30-mers and 14-3-3τ
were found. In combination with the MST results of early multimerization, this indicates
that 14-3-3τ does not interact with a specific αS multimer or size, but rather exhibits a
more general interaction. Additionally, colocalization in confocal imaging and MST experiment
suggest that 14-3-3τ binds to αS fibrils.
These insights enhance the understanding of how 14-3-3 proteins modulate αS aggregation
and may support the development of new therapeutic approaches for Parkinson’s disease. Master Applied Physics (M-AP)",Master Biomedical Engineering (M-BME),"Heidema, Christel G.",July 2025,English,"No

This study examines spatial and temporal patterns of the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) from 2013 to 2023 across forested regions of NSW and evaluates the exposure of koala habitat suitability zones to high fire risk. Monthly FFDI was calculated using temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation from ERA5 and TerraClimate datasets. Harmonic regression identified seasonal patterns, K-means clustering revealed regions with similar FFDI behavior, and Mann–Kendall tests assessed long-term trends. Annual high-risk fire areas (FFDI ≥ 12) ranged from 160,450 to 363,150 km², peaking in 2019. Comparison with wildfire records showed partial spatial overlap, particularly during the 2019–2020 fire season. Fire danger peaked consistently during austral summer, especially in northeastern and inland regions. Overlay with MaxEnt-modeled koala habitat maps showed over half of high-suitability zones faced repeated high fire danger.

This highlights the importance of the environment of the female reproductive tract in the fertilization process, more specific the sperm interactions with oviductal epithelial cells (OEC's) in the so called sperm reservoir. To study these interactions, INRAE in France created spheroids from self-assembled OEC's (called OvidOUTs). In collaboration with the AMBER group, they are developing a sperm reservoir-on-a-chip model with the aim of incorporating these OvidOUTs into a microfluidic device with physiological flow of oviduct fluid. To facilitate the microfluidic design process, the work described in this article proposes the use of hyaluronic acid (HA) and lectin-coated polystyrene (PS) beads as standardized surrogate OvidOUTs. Assessment of the coating efficiency indicated that pre-incubating the PS beads with poly-L-lysine improved the coating efficiency via surface adsorption. A sperm binding test was performed with the beads, as done with the OvidOUTs. There were few non-specific interactions between the uncoated beads and bovine sperm cells, whereas the HA and lectin-coated beads showed a higher number of bound sperm cells.

107753,Splitting Motorways : A Capacity and Safety Evaluation of Lane Configuration Types in Motorway Splits,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107753,"The design of motorways is captured in guidelines, such as the ROA for the Netherlands. These 
provide, amongst others, information on standard designs of several motorway elements. One 
of these elements is a motorway split, a point on a motorway where the original road is split in 
two new roads (branches). Despite the guidelines provide information on which configurations 
can be used, a clear substantiation is missing. The present substantiation is brief and not 
connected to quantitative factors such as directional distribution or truck share. At the same 
time, there is a wish to update the guidelines to ensure good performance on capacity and 
traffic safety nowadays and in the future. This study therefore aims to provide substantiated and 
updated advice on applying several lane configurations in motorway splitting, for several 
combinations of traffic circumstances as directional distribution and truck share. The central 
question in this investigation is: “What is, regarding capacity and traffic safety, the best lane 
configuration in splitting motorways for various circumstances in the motorway network?”
Various guidelines from the Netherlands and abroad were studied on which configurations they 
recommend for splitting motorways. A selection of configuration designs has been chosen to 
simulate in FOSIM, software that is specially designed to simulate traffic on Dutch motorways.
For various directional distributions and truck shares, simulations were performed on the 
designs to determine their traffic capacity. To determine traffic safety, several safety indicators 
were calculated based on measured lane changes and decelerations of vehicles during the 
simulations. In the end, the configurations were compared to each other using these values for 
capacity and safety indicators, equally weighing capacity and safety.
Overall truck share slightly influences the capacity of all considered configurations. The 
influence of directional distribution on capacity is stronger. All configurations tend to have their 
maximum capacity for a directional distribution such that the majority of the traffic uses the 
original lanes. This way, the number of lane changes seems to be lower, preventing a bottleneck 
on the pre-sorting section. The designs performing the best on capacity are therefore 
configurations with a lane addition (in other words, a non-original lane) added to the side that 
takes the least traffic. When the majority of traffic taking one branch becomes too large 
however, the branch congests, limiting the capacity of the complete section.
The quality of the used safety indicators appeared to be not sufficient enough to draw reliable 
conclusions from. The time needed to perform enough traffic simulations for statistical 
significant safety results was larger than the available time for this research. Moreover, during 
the computation and analysis of the safety indicators, it was found that capacity and traffic 
safety are related more closely that initially thought, which should have been included in the 
safety indicators. The capacity results, that are statistically significant, form the basis of the 
capacity-related advice that could finetune the motorway design guidelines. It is however 
recommended to pay more attention to truck share in further research, in particular to truck 
shares that vary between the two branches. For safety-related advice, it is recommended to 
first investigate the possible relationship between the safety indicators and traffic capacity and 
compute the values of the indicators more accurately, before evaluating the total safety 
performance of the considered configurations. Finally, it is recommended to investigate the 
configuration designs on how they function in practice. Despite FOSIM is calibrated on the 
Dutch motorway network, a comparison between the capacity and safety findings from 
simulations and practice could increase the quality of the results and conclusions.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Boender, N.",July 2025,English,"No

107752,Multi-Source Attack Graph Generation with MS-SAGE,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107752,"Understanding attacker strategies is essential for analyzing cyber threats, but it can be a time-consuming due to the extensive analysis involved. Attack graph generation methods aim to simplify this by providing a structured overview of attacks while reducing the data that must be examined. One such method, SAGE, builds attack graphs from network-based alerts by analyzing the temporal relationships between them. However, SAGE’s reliance solely on network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) can be limiting. Some attacker actions might go undetected if they are only visible at the host level or if the NIDS is misconfigured, resulting in incomplete graphs. To overcome this, we introduce MS-SAGE—a modified, multi-source version of SAGE and the first proof-of-concept approach to generate attack graphs using multiple data sources without requiring prior expert knowledge. MS-SAGE combines alerts from different sources, identifies attacker actions, and uses a model to merge similar behaviors. We evaluated MS-SAGE using a dataset from the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT). The results show that our multi-source method produces attack graphs that are up to 45% more accurate and 135% more complete than the best single-source method. These gains come from leveraging strong indicators across sources to fill gaps left by individual systems.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Lotgerink, W.J.",July 2025,English,"No

107742,Estimating misconnecting passengers to enhance decision-making on the Minimal Connecting Time for KLM.,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107742,"The Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij (KLM), which is the largest Dutch airline, currently does not have an informed
method to define the Minimal Connecting Time (MCT) for their flight connections. This report presents a study on
informed MCT decision-making based on misconnecting passenger predictions tailored to individual flight connections at
KLM. The MCT refers to the minimum time between the inbound flight and the outbound flight of a flight connection,
such that passengers can make their connection. In aviation, misconnecting passengers are referred to as No Connection
(NOC) passengers and are costly for airlines.
KLM is currently using fixed MCTs per flight connection category, which are based on whether a flight destination is in
Europe (EUR), intercontinental (ICA), a Schengen (S) country or a non-Schengen (N) country. In the season of summer
2024, KLM used an MCT of confidential minutes for EUR-EUR connections and an MCT of confidential minutes for
EUR-ICA, ICA-EUR, ICA-ICA connections. The MCTs for the EUR-EUR connections were tailored for S-S (confidential
minutes), N-S (confidential minutes), S-N (confidential minutes) and N-N (confidential minutes) connections in the season
of winter 2024, as the MCT of confidential minutes was considered to short for the N-S, S-N and N-N connections. As
the field of Machine Learning has evolved over the last decades, KLM is interested in whether the NOC rate of individual
flight connections can be predicted using Machine Learning models, such that better informed decisions on the MCTs
can be made. The NOC rate is defined as the number of NOC passengers divided by the total number of connecting
passengers on the same individual flight connection. To predict the NOC rates of individual flight connections to enhance
decision-making on the MCT using Machine Learning, we formulated the following research question:

As the number of these fast bikes increases, so do the accidents involving them. Smart Connected Bicycles (SCBs) aim to improve the traffic safety of e-bikes by incorporating smart features that can prevent accidents. Furthermore, SCBs with additional smart technology have the potential to create a more pleasurable and uninterrupted ride. These positive effects only materialise if users want to use the SCBs. To answer this question, it is first necessary to understand how the emotional response of users can be measured.Both biomedical sensors and more traditional methods, such as surveys and in-ride feedback, are used. Biomedical sensors appear to be beneficial, but their data should be critically verified, especially when using newer technology such as wearables. The primary focus of this thesis is on the emotion of delight, as this is an important indicator that the user wants to adopt the system. Delight is defined as an emotional state of high arousal and high valence. Four systems are then evaluated for delight in two field trials: two notification systems and two adaptive motor power systems. The systems that interfered less with the ride (audible notifications and disabling the support motor) were perceived more positively than systems that interfered more with the ride (haptic notifications and automatic braking). For all systems, older and non-Dutch people are more likely to want to adopt the system.

The analysis shows that platform design significantly affects participation: offline facilitation,
institutional coordination, continuous incentives, dialogic transparency systematically shrink
motivational and usage gaps, whereas rigid process pipelines that lack visible institutional followthrough tend to widen skills and usage gaps for already disadvantaged groups. Thus, the degree to which
digital collaborative-governance tools reduce or reproduce inequalities depends less on the mere
adoption of new technology than on how responsively that technology is embedded in existing civic and
administrative practices.

107727,What Do Narcissists on Reddit Talk About? : An Exploratory Text-Mining Study,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107727,"The concept of vulnerable narcissism has largely been neglected in research, although it is recognized as an important part of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). Since insights into the real-life experiences and emotions of vulnerable narcissists are missing, the subreddit r/NPD was investigated. It was hypothesized that primarily vulnerable narcissists would post on this subreddit which is meant for narcissists who want to talk about their problems and get support. Using a text mining approach, the current study aimed to uncover what (vulnerable) narcissists on r/NPD talk about and which sentiments/emotions they express. Data consisted of 809 top-rated posts. The most prevalent topic was ‘Frustration with Relationships’ (21.6% of posts), followed by five more topics discussing emotional struggles, isolation, narcissistic traits, trauma, and recovery. The average expressed sentiment was negative. Sadness was the discrete emotion primarily expressed (60.07% of posts). Difficulties with interpersonal relationships was the central theme discussed across topics. One topic revealed that the stigmatization surrounding narcissism might partly explain vulnerable narcissists’ experiences of isolation. Additionally, the predominance of the emotion sadness presents a novel finding.

environmental and ethical concern. This thesis explores how animated storytelling can be
used to reduce clothing overconsumption among high-consuming young adults. Two short videos were created using different
persuasive framings: one with a positive, gain-framed message and one with a negative,
loss-framed message. Both videos followed the same narrative structure and were tailored
towards short-form platforms such as TikTok and Instagram.
To evaluate their impact, participants (ages 18-30) were shown one of the two videos,
followed by a survey and an interview. The results showed that both videos were emotionally
engaging and had a clear message. The gain-framed video was perceived as upbeat, and seemed to be more effective on viewers who were already somewhat aware
on sustainable fashion practices. The loss-framed video resulted in stronger emotional
reactions and was more effective in raising awareness among less informed viewers.
The videos did not consistently lead to
a clear intention to change behavior. Several design requirements were only partially met,
which may have limited the persuasive impact. This research highlights the potential of
short-form animated storytelling as a communication tool for changing behavior in clothing

Based on theories of procedural and distributive justice, this paper analyses how participants perceive the police in terms of voice, neutrality, respect, trustworthiness and trust; and how they assess the distribution of police resources and treatment in their respective neighborhoods. The research follows a qualitative, comparative case study design, based on six semi-structured interviews with parents employed in the education sector. A structured coding system is used to analyze the data. This system scores participants' statements enabling evaluation of the statements and comparison between cases. The findings suggest that procedural justice plays a central role in shaping perceptions of police legitimacy, while distributive justice also contributes but appears to be less influential. Additionally, participants from Innenstadt-Ost consistently report higher levels of perceived police legitimacy, along with higher levels of procedural and distributive justice, than those from Nordstadt. Responses from Nordstadt are more ambivalent and often shaped by negative experiences, resulting in lower evaluations across all measured neighborhood totals.","Bachelor Management, Society and Technology (B-MST)","Kix, Helen Jill",June 2025,English,"No

We show that Z-opt achieves a worst-case approximation ratio of O(log^2(n)) and an average-case ratio of O(1) for Euclidean instances, along with a worst-case approximation ratio of O(√n) for general metric instances. Furthermore, we analyse the 3-opt heuristic for the Asymmetric TSP (ATSP) and establish a worst-case approximation ratio lower bound of Ω(n).

107713,Types of Ruptures and Repairs in the Therapeutic Relationship : A Scoping Review,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107713,"Background: Ruptures in the therapeutic relationship are defined as tensions or breakdowns and repair is needed to continue the relationship. In order to create an overview of the different views on what causes ruptures and what is needed for repair, an integrative study is needed. 
Objectives: This scoping review provides an answer to the question: “What are reasons for ruptures between therapist and client to occur and in what way may they be repaired?” 
Methods: A scoping review was chosen as a methodology. Literature search which delivered 36 articles. A hybrid thematic analysis was carried out, meaning deductive and inductive coding were used. There were two deductive codes for the repair of ruptures: general steps for rupture resolution and based on type of rupture – withdrawal/confrontation. These were based on previous literature. The other codes and themes were found inductively. 
Results: Within the overarching theme reasons for ruptures, the following themes were found: incompatibility therapist-client, client challenges, and therapist’s contributions. The second overarching theme is ways to repair, with themes therapist’s guideline, insight into client, personal relationship repair, and therapist actions. 
Discussion: Concluding, ruptures could be due to a mismatch in the therapist-client relationship, problems caused by the client and problems caused by the therapist. For repair, there was a general, always applicable, solution, a way to learn more about the client, a method focusing on personal relationship repair, and some techniques therapists can use.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Jansen, S.A.",July 2025,English,"No

The aim was to evaluate the system’s usability for monitoring the integrity of an ARPE-19 cell monolayer in preparation for future experiments. Barrier integrity is a critical parameter for studying drug delivery across the outer blood–retina barrier (oBRB), particularly in the context of retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Organ-on-a-Chip (OoC) models offer a promising alternative to animal models by mimicking key aspects of human physiology, yet they require non-invasive and reliable methods to assess barrier function. Recent technological advances have enabled the integration of electrodes into microfluidic chips, facilitating transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements via impedance spectroscopy. This label-free technique allows continuous, in vitro monitoring of barrier properties. However, measurement equipment must often be tailored to the specific layout and requirements of the chip. Although the Artemis system was developed for such applications, its compatibility and performance required validation. Validation experiments confirmed expected impedance trends with varying ion concentrations and membrane presence. However, in cell culture experiments, impedance values were higher than expected, indicating the need for further investigation into the system’s sensitivity and calibration.",Bachelor Biomedical Engineering (B-BMT),"Tromp, S.",July 2025,English,"No

Encapsulin, a protein nanocage, holds a great advantage in this field due to its biocompatibility and modification possibilities. The 23 to 24 nm encapsulin from Thermotoga maritima, consisting of 60 monomers, can be engineered to target specific cells. Upon reaching the target cell, the cargo must be released. Moreover, the polyhistidine tail, used for purification, is disfavoured due to its immunogenicity and should therefore be removed for biomedical applications. This research investigates the feasibility of cargo release as well as purification tag removal from Tm encapsulin via cleavage by TEV protease. To enable cargo release, a protease recognition sequence is added to each monomer. Tm encapsulin forms stable cages by inserting a cleaving sequence, flanked by linkers, at position 127 and 242. Proteolysis of Tm encapsulin by TEV protease is proved more challenging than expected. Despite several attempts, no significant cleavage was observed. The possible causes for this include structural specificity of the protease and steric hindrance. Nevertheless, an assay to monitor cargo release, named FLYNT and STYL, was designed. This theoretical design is based on split luciferase, generating luminescence upon cargo release. Attempts to modify the C-terminal, to cleave off the purification tag, resulted in insoluble proteins. Although no successful cleavage of Tm encapsulin was achieved, the results contribute to the development of Tm encapsulin as a drug delivery system.",Master Biomedical Engineering (M-BME),"Buijs, F.A.H.",July 2025,English,"No.

This thesis contributes to that project by investigating how information design, focused on clear communication and engagement, can be used to create an interactive installation that showcases Creative Technology to Dutch high school students. Adopting the Design Thinking methodology, the project followed a human-centred and iterative approach. The research began with a contextual analysis involving interviews with faculty and alumni, focus groups with first and third-year students, and observations of current outreach. A thematic analysis of the data was conducted to identify key characteristics of the programme, challenges in its communication, and the motivations and behaviours of prospective students. These findings were complemented by a literature review and a state-of-the-art analysis, resulting in a set of design requirements for the final installation.

Methods: The ”Inductive visual directly follows miner” algorithm was applied to the MIMIC-IV
dataset to discover care pathways of pancreatic cancer patients. Care processes of different
pancreatic cancer subgroups were discovered and compared through cross-log conformance
checking.
Results: Age and initial tumour location were found to cause the most differing care paths,
although differences in average cross-log precision were statistically insignificant. Models of the
final four subgroups for diagnosis and treatment care paths had moderate conformance measure
performances.

As flexible workstations have become more standard, organizations face challenges regarding efficient office occupancy. A radar prototype was developed to detect real-time desk occupancy without requiring any user input. The system achieved 99.5% accuracy in testing and was also evaluated through expert validation, who, although they confirmed the relevance and technical promise of the solution, raised concerns about scalability, power consumption, and useradoption.
To guide the development, the Design Science Methodology (DSM) was applied, enabling iterative problem investigation. An extensive literature review revealed that many existing smart office solutions prioritize building-level automation rather than an employee-centered design. Through interviews with facility managers at six large organizations, current practices and common inefficiencies were benchmarked, confirming the need for a simple, accurate, and privacy-
preserving desk occupancy solution.
Sensor testing compared radar, PIR and ultrasonic options, with the radar sensor emerging as the most effective in terms of accuracy and deployment feasibility. A simple webinterface was also developed to display real-time occupancy data. Expert feedback emphasized the importance of modular design and alignment with existing infrastructure and user workflows.

107697,From Digital Twin to HCI: Human-Computer Interaction on the Shop Floor for the Reaction to Deviations,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107697,"In highly automated production environments, production workers face the challenge of detecting and responding to deviations quickly. In this work, conducted at a manufacturing company, a user-centered design approach was applied to develop and prototype a concept aimed at improving Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) on the shop floor for the reaction to deviations. While the initial focus was on utilizing a Digital Twin of the production to achieve this support, the research scope expanded after it became clear that the practical advantages of Digital Twins for the reaction to deviations are currently limited. With a broader scope, the objective was to identify how existing or new technologies can be integrated and should be designed to support the full reaction process of detection, resolution and escalation. For that, Contextual Inquiries were conducted with operators and line supervisors. Additionally, expert focus groups provided insights on processes and responsibilities. With the insights, ideas for future reaction flows were derived and evaluated from a user, technical, and economic perspective. The resulting prototypes were tested with both operators and line supervisors. The findings indicate that deviation alerts must be clearly visible, concise, and may include reliable action recommendations. Enabling the forwarding and creation of alerts to supervisors and therefore improving communication appears promising if feedback mechanisms are implemented. For line supervisors, a mobile solution with the option to create tickets for maintenance can be a potential support. To further support workers in the production, future research should explore additional reaction indicators and the application of Digital Twins in scenarios requiring broader overviews, such as shift changes.",Master Interaction Technology (M-ITECH),"Pütz, Caroline",July 2025,English,"No

However, students, teachers, staff, and visitors hardly interact with the installation, thus missing the visualised data. Additionally, many people struggle to connect kilowatt-hours (kWh) to their activities. These challenges are both addressed in this graduation project by designing multiple interactive data visualisations (IDVs) for the Dataskyline that aim to be accessible, engaging and easy to understand. The visualisations include translations of kWh’s into relatable units, weekly energy usage of Saxion’s buildings, rankings between buildings and floors and tips on how to decrease energy consumption. An element displaying a “question of the day” was added to provoke curiosity and encourage repeated visits. User evaluation showed that although knowledge gains were minor, participants did report an increase in confidence while answering knowledge questions, as well as their ability to compare the energy usage of Saxion’s buildings and devices.

107695,A Data-Driven model for financially viable fiber-optic network expansion at KPN,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107695,"KPN has rapidly expanded its fiber-optic network across the Netherlands, yet many buildings—especially high-rise and duplex properties—remain unconnected. As KPN shifts from rapid roll-out to maximizing customer connections and capital efficiency, it needs a more granular, transparent selection approach. Currently, decisions rely on the previous selection model, which predicts area-level returns but lacks building-level cost and customer insights, leading to manual interpretation and suboptimal capital allocation. This thesis, conducted with KPN’s Fiber Connect Planning & Capacity team, develops a data-driven method to prioritize financially viable buildings. It integrates machine learning predictions of customer uptake, routing-based cost heuristics, and feasibility checks for constraints like demolition risk and overbuild. The combined score ranks buildings, which are clustered into coherent projects, supporting practical planning. Sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of the method under different assumptions. Trained on KPN data, the predictive model achieves a macro F1 score of 0.65 and an AUC of 0.67, outperforming baselines. Cost experiments show trench routes average 27% longer than straight lines, and multi-unit buildings reduce per-address costs, aligning with historical data. The approach is implemented in a Power BI tool for planners.

Regenerative Agriculture (RA) is an approach to farming that takes soil conservation at its core, utilizing natural processes to restore ecosystems. However, a number of obstacles make adoption difficult. A need for an RA supply tool was identified. In collaboration with Foodvalley, an independent organization aimed at bettering the food system, the client for this project, this thesis aimed to develop an interactive communication tool on an RA supply chain in Gelderland that could encourage knowledge-sharing, as well as aid in making better-informed decisions among stakeholders. The finished interactive animation depicted a regenerative supply chain from seed supplier to consumer. It combined hand-drawn visuals, narration, interaction, and educational elements, and was designed using the Creative Technology Design Process. Evaluations showed that the tool was able to successfully educate on RA methods, piquing curiosity and being recognized as a conversation starter.

This thesis presents a structured approach that forecasts energy demand on
construction sites and supports the selection of supplemental power technologies
when grid capacity falls short. The approach integrates real-world
equipment data, project planning models, and decision-support tools, including
the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), decision matrix, and decision
trees. These models are evaluated for their ability to assist construction
managers in selecting the most suitable temporary power setups. Expert
feedback indicated that decision trees are the most intuitive and user-friendly,

However, individuals with severe physical disabilities who use powered wheelchairs often face barriers to engaging in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs)—tasks like housekeeping, cooking, and managing finances. These are essential for independent living and social inclusion but are often inaccessible due to physical, social, and systemic challenges. This thesis explores the design of a wheelchair-mounted cleaning device to support active participation in cleaning, thereby enhancing independence and inclusion. Following the Creative Technology Design Process and Human-Centred Design principles, the project adopted an iterative approach through ideation, specification, realisation, and evaluation. A formative user evaluation with eight care facility residents showed increased perceived contribution and usefulness, with a System Usability Score (SUS) of 72.5. Users highlighted challenges such as limited visibility from the device's rear placement and maneuverability issues with caster wheels. Despite limitations including prototype fragility and a small sample size, the study shows strong potential for assistive cleaning tools to boost autonomy.

It is the process of identifying the location of a given image and retrieving images captured at the same place. It is an essential component in the navigation of mobile robots, visual question answering, and autonomous driving. It is crucial that these models perform image retrieval tasks successfully in different weather conditions. In this study, we investigate the use of a captioning step within visual place recognition with the goal of improving the resistance of visual place recognition to differences in the query image. We specifically look at visual place recognition at a lower level by using a pipeline which emits the retrieval step and outputs image encodings, which would be used for image retrieval in an actual visual place recognition pipeline. We implement a pipeline using the ExpansionNet LLM to caption the image, the CLIP VLM to encode the image and the caption of the image. By introducing corruptions in the query image, we test the effectiveness of a captioning step in the pipeline. We find that with a caption, the results show a consistent 40% increase in resistance to corruption.",Bachelor Technical Computer Science (B-TCS),"Meijer, Pepijn",June 2025,English,"No

While many young people are aware of the problem, they often remain stuck in the contemplation phase of behavioural change, recognizing the issue but not yet preparing to act. Much attention has been paid to the intention-action gap, but this project focuses on the lesser-known gap between contemplation and preparation, where the earliest internal shifts must occur. This bachelor graduation project explores how design can support teenagers in progressing from contemplation to preparation around sustainable fashion behaviour. Using the Creative Technology Design Method, a concept was developed through ideation, prototyping, and testing. The result is a physical card game that promotes reflection, awareness, and critical thinking, linked to a website with additional challenges, educational content, and opportunities for social sharing. The concept was evaluated at a Dutch high school with 14 teenagers, using a mixed-methods approach that included both qualitative insights and quantitative data, analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Findings show that while the card game does not directly change behaviour, it was well received and effective in raising awareness and stimulating reflection on sustainable fashion in a low-barrier, social format. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that playful, reflective tools can help bridge the early gaps in behavioural change, nudging teens toward sustainable mindsets, even if full behavioural transformation takes more time and further intervention.",Bachelor Creative Technology (B-CREA),"Volders, Yana",July 2025,English,"No

Some of the organizations believe that Regenerative Agriculture(RA) could alleviate some of the issues. Regenerative agriculture is a somewhat open term, but in wide strokes it is a holistic approach that aims for a healthier soil and ecosystem on and around farms. This thesis tried to create a solution to display progress of RA initiative in a flexible and farmer-oriented way.

Despite its potential to reduce the one-third of global food wasted, and approximately 25% in the Netherlands, public awareness remains limited. This lack of consumer knowledge is a key barrier to adoption. While previous studies have examined public opinions, this study focuses on how to create awareness of nanotechnology in food packaging to address food waste. Methods: This qualitative study involved four semi-structured focus groups with eco-conscious and non- eco-conscious consumers, as well as two semi-structured interviews with three experts in nanotechnology and food packaging. Results: Participants had limited knowledge of nanotechnology in food packaging and often confused it with unrelated fields. While benefits like reduced food waste were seen, trust concerns remained. Preferred information channels differed by age, but trust was highest in independent institutions like universities and public media. Visual tools such as QR codes on packages were favored for delivering deeper, non- commercial information. Experts proposed a three-step model: scientists introduce the technology, manufacturers communicate transparently, and consumers access information via trusted platforms. Conclusion: Clear, assessable, and tailored science communication is important for bridging the knowledge gap around nanotechnology in food packaging. By addressing trust, perceived risks, and audience needs, such communication shapes public attitudes and behavioral intentions. When framed around practical benefits like food waste reduction, it supports acceptance and enables informed, socially responsible choices at the intersection of innovation, policy, and everyday consumption.",Master Communication Science (M-COM),"Janssen, Mart Huub",July 2025,English,"No.

This study addresses that gap by developing a data-driven model to simulate landslide susceptibility and estimate infrastructure exposure under different seismic hazard scenarios. Using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) trained on inventories from the 2011 Van and 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes, the model incorporates six key variables: slope, local relief, PGA, proximity to faults, lithology, and land cover. Susceptibility was simulated across Türkiye under four PGA exceedance probabilities (2%, 10%, 50%, and 68% in 50 years), showing increasing landslide likelihood with stronger but rarer earthquakes. Exposure analysis revealed that infrastructure overlap shifts from lower to higher susceptibility zones as earthquake intensity increases. While the model does not simulate runout or dynamic conditions, it offers a practical, scenario-based framework for national risk assessment.

While these methods can be effective, they often require extensive training data and do not account for the student model’s specific learning weaknesses, which can lead to redundant training on material the student model has already mastered, or, conversely, to the omission of new and potentially valuable knowledge. In this paper, we explore Selective Knowledge Transfer via Communication-Aware Model Alignment, a novel approach where a teacher model iteratively identifies and addresses a student model’s deficiencies through dynamic interaction. The teacher generates targeted examples, evaluates student responses, and adjusts its strategy to focus on areas of weakness, using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment. Our method introduces an adaptive interaction mechanism, but empirical evaluations show mixed results: while most experiments exhibit performance degradation compared to traditional distillation, one setting demonstrates a slight improvement. These findings underscore the challenges of aligning dynamic interaction with effective knowledge retention and suggest directions for refining communication-based distillation strategies.

From subalpine to tropical regions, forests cover nearly one-third of the earth’s land surface. Forests are generally known as the “lungs of the planet” as they absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen in the air. Forests worldwide are suffering negative impacts from climate change-related droughts. Calabrian pines (Pinus brutia) form forest in the driest parts of the Mediterranean region exposed to long dry seasons. In addition to drought, multiple other factors are potential causes of stress to pine trees leading to their mortality. However, spatial patterns of tree mortality are not uniform. When multiple factors are in place, the patterns of tree mortality on the landscape level could reveal its drivers.
To identify the mortality drivers in Pinus brutia assessment of topographical variables is important as they influence the tree mortality on a local level. However, the ranking of topographic drivers in order of their influence on tree mortality is unknown. Thus, finding out the most influencing topographical driver on tree mortality was the main objective of this study. Additionally, during the field work, it was observed that the mortality in large-sized trees was more than in small-sized trees. Thus, analysing the effect of tree size on tree mortality was also one of the objectives of this study.
Until now, the research on identifying influential drivers of tree mortality has mostly been done using statistical modelling and data was collected using traditional field methods and satellite or aerial images. To further improve the knowledge about tree mortality, this study uses the data collected from UAV and field observation in the Mediterranean forest, Crete Island, Greece. The analysis was done using GLM and RF models to identify the topographical mortality drivers from the study area. Analysis was performed on two levels, individual tree mortality; focusing on the relationship between tree size and tree mortality and plot-level mortality; focusing on tree mortality percentage in the study area.
This study shows a positive relationship between tree size and tree mortality. Additionally, tree density is also influencing tree mortality percentage in the region. Out of all the topographic variables considered, the slope showed a positive influence on tree mortality. Furthermore, elevation reduces the probability of tree mortality percentage for trees situated at a higher elevation.

107670,Evaluating the usefulness of NDVI time series in modelling the distribution of priority reptiles of Greece,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107670,"Biodiversity is a major public discussion topic, especially changes in biodiversity caused by human and natural processes. Sustaining biodiversity requires an awareness of its geographical distribution and pattern, as well as an understanding of the mechanisms that drive biodiversity at various scales. Greece is home to a large proportion of European species that are vulnerable on a European scale and thus bears considerable responsibility for protecting them within its borders. As a member of the European Union, Greece has pledged to prevent biodiversity loss and, like other EU members, will report every six years on the conservation status of its species. One of the potential approaches is to identify the key environmental variables that influence species distribution. Most early research that used species distribution models (SDM) at large spatial ranges (e.g., global, national, or regional) relied only on climatic/topographic predictors. Remotely sensed datasets are becoming more useful in SDM for identifying, characterising, and predicting animal habitats. In this study, species distribution modelling was carried out in Greece to evaluate the usefulness of using variables derived from the time-series of MODIS NDVI in models predicting the distribution of 42 priority reptiles in Greece. The modelling used data representing 7897 observations after data thinning, 42 species after removing the species with records below the number of explanatory variables, and 20 explanatory variables after removing correlated variables. Hyper-temporal NDVI and other environmental variables (e.g., climate, topography, geology) were used as biophysical features of the ecosystem. The three sets of models were built in Maxent (maximum entropy modelling), which are NDVI-based, commonly used, and combined. The discrimination power of these models was assessed by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) and True skill statistic (TSS). The predictability of NDVI time series-based variables was investigated by comparing the commonly used and combined model performance. The results showed that MODIS NDVI-based metrics did not improve the model performance, however AUC and TSS slightly increased. Furthermore, the discriminating power measured by AUC showed that the NDVI-based model is a good predictor with a mean above 0.7, while TSS contradicts this with a mean of 0.35. Although NDVI-based metrics did not improve the model performance, it was among the four most important variables to 7 species, showing that it has valuable information to model certain reptiles. Precipitation of driest month and digital elevation model were the most important variables across many species. The findings of this research may contribute significantly to a better understanding of the ecological requirements of the species and may assist in setting priorities regarding conservation of reptiles in Greece.

107669,Development of a Low-Cost Haptic device for Mixing Force and Visual Feedback in Extended Reality Environments,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107669,"Training for needle-based medical procedures such as biopsies requires the ability to perceive subtle tactile cues while maintaining spatial precision. Conventional training methods using cadavers or synthetic phantoms provide valuable experience but are often costly, limited in availability, and lacking in long term reusability. Extended Reality (XR) environments, including Augmented Reality (AR), offer a promising alternative by enabling immersive and interactive simulations. Haptic feedback technology offers a means to replicate subtle tactile cues, enhancing the realism of simulated interactions. This study presents a low-cost haptic device integrated into an XR system. The system combines a single-axis mechanical actuator, a force-feedback control interface, and AR visualization using a Microsoft HoloLens 2. Three distinct force feedback profiles, impenetrable, dynamic, and penetrable boundaries, were developed to simulate various interaction scenarios. A user study involving ten participants was conducted to evaluate perceived fidelity across 2D and AR visual conditions. Results showed that the impenetrable boundary model yielded the highest perceived fidelity, particularly in AR. In contrast, the penetrable and dynamic models were impacted by latency and desynchronization between the haptic feedback and the visualisation.

Kenya and South Africa reduce educational inequality for menstruating pupils. Guided by the
Capabilities Approach and Sommer’s Theory of Change, the study evaluates whether policy frameworks
enhance girls’ educational opportunities and how implementation quality shapes outcomes. By using a
deductive qualitative content analysis of policy documents, academic literature, and Non-Governmental
Organisation (NGO) reports, the research compares the foundational elements, implementation
activities, as well as outcomes and impacts of MHM policies in both countries. Findings reveal that
Kenya and South Africa have made policy advances with several context-specific examples serving as
best practices for MHM implementation. Nevertheless, the analysis reveals that persistent challenges
remain. These mainly include infrastructural gaps, uneven implementation, and inadequate monitoring.
The study concludes that, if comprehensive MHM interventions are effectively implemented, they show
positive outcomes. Still, although national policies are necessary for promoting educational equality and
menstrual dignity, their effectiveness is constrained by contextual barriers and insufficient data. The
research highlights the need for more comprehensive, context-sensitive approaches, improved
monitoring, and intersectional analyses. Ultimately, this thesis contributes to the academic and policy

These systems, which often adopt a monolithic architecture, can be migrated toward a more flexible microservices architecture that can potentially provide more maintainability and scalability. This thesis presents a practical roadmap to guide financial organizations in migrating their existing systems to microservices using low-code. By leveraging low-code, an increasingly popular approach to software development that shares technical resemblance with microservices, organizations can accelerate their migration process. Within the migration process, low-code can be used as a prototyping tool and a tool to develop microservices.

The modularity refers to the pipeline’s decoupled design, in which each stage (road segmentation, lane detection, steering logic) is developed, trained, and optimized independently, allowing flexible integration and upgrade of individual components. A central contribution is the use of road segmentation as a spatial prior to guide lane detection, enhancing robustness in challenging scenarios such as shadows, reflections, and ambiguous markings. The pipeline employs two efficient neural networks: RoadNetLite for road segmentation and LaneNetMobile for lane detection, both incorporating spatial attention and multi-scale feature extraction via Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP). The models are specifically designed for real-time inference on CPUs or resource-limited computers, making them suitable for embedded deployment. They are trained and evaluated on benchmark datasets including Cityscapes and TuSimple, using binary masks and a combined Dice and CrossEntropy loss to balance accuracy and speed. Results show inference times below 25 milliseconds per frame on standard CPUs, while achieving binary mIoU scores above 0.94.

107661,Understanding Dropout in Web-Based Interventions : Identifying Latent User Subgroups and Influencing Factors,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107661,"Background: Web-Based Interventions (WBIs) offer promising solutions to the global mental health treatment gap. Despite advantages such as their accessibility and scalability, WBIs often suffer from high dropout rates. While both person- and intervention-related factors have been linked to early dropout, research has yet to fully explore the relationship between these elements. Therefore, this study investigates whether specific subgroups of
users can be identified based on dropout patterns. Further, it explores what influence User Experience (UX) design choices, participants attitudes towards WBIs, and usability scores have on dropout patterns. Methods: Data were collected from 87 participants who dropped out of one of three WBIs developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. A Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) was conducted to identify groups of users based on age, education level,
symptom severity, usability scores, and number of modules completed. Additional statistical tests were used to assess the impact of usability and UX design on adherence. Results: The LPA revealed four distinct user profiles, each differing in symptom severity (on scales measuring sleep disturbances, depression & anxiety), point of dropout, and demographic
characteristics. One subgroup with moderate symptoms and high education levels, showed significantly higher module completion than the rest. However, hypothesis testing showed no significant relationship between system usability, user attitudes, or UX design features and adherence rates. Conclusion: The findings imply that dropout is not solely driven by usability or design choices but by a complex interplay of personal and contextual factors. Implementing a UX-focused design did not significantly improve adherence, and both highly
symptomatic and low-symptom users dropped out for different reasons. These results highlight the need for more personalised, context-specific approaches when designing WBIs.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Wrana, Jasper",July 2025,English,"No

Rooted in the principles of Industry 5.0, the student-centered design philosophy has become a core guideline for developing AI-driven educational tools. In line with this approach, ensuring the usability of AI-powered educational chatbots is an essential precondition to the delivery of high-quality tools to assist students in education. The University of Twente supported the development of BuddyGPT, an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist students in retrieving course-related information from the university educational platform, i.e., Canvas. The present work presents and discusses the results of the usability assessment of BuddyGPT in order to provide actionable design recommendations to support its future development. This study used a within-subjects design. A total of 53 participants were invited to use BuddyGPT to achieve three tasks associated with a course called Software Systems at the University of Twente. During the experience, four main variables were collected, with effectiveness (task success rate and query reformulation rate), efficiency (task completion time), satisfaction (BUS-11 scale), and recommendation intent (individual-level Net Promoter Score). Overall, BuddyGPT enabled participants to complete 77.7% of the tasks. Participants yielded an average satisfaction score of 3.49, indicating the participants were satisfied with BuddyGPT. A group-level Net Promoter Score of 14.3 reflects strong user loyalty and a high likelihood of recommending BuddyGPT. Moreover, we measured relationships among the main factors in the evaluation. For instance, results confirmed the correlation between individual-level Net Promoter Score and satisfaction; nevertheless, they did not find the expected correlation between the effectiveness and efficiency of people's performance in the tasks and their declared satisfaction.

Mobile mental health apps offer a scalable and cost-effective solution. Apps based on positive psychology could bridge the treatment gap. But there remains limited insight into the effectiveness of specific positive pychology intervention elements used within these apps.  Methods: To examine the association between positive psychology intervention elements and changes in depression and anxiety scores, a bivariate mixed-effect meta-regression model with univariable analyses was used. Results: Out of the 222 studies in this meta-analysis, only 18.4% used gratitude, 11.7% used savoring, and 10.8% used personal strengths and optimism. Small but significant associations with reductions in depressive symptoms were found for gratitude (g = -0.25, p < .001), savoring (g = -0.30, p < .001), and optimism (g = -0.18, p <.05). For anxiety, only gratitude (g = -0.15, p < .05) and savoring (g = -0.15, p < .05) showed small but significant effects.

In recent decades, the size of wind turbines has increased to capture more energy per turbine. This increase in size poses challenging conditions for the wind turbine blades, where tip speed can reach over 300 km/h. In harsh environmental conditions, impacts of rain and hail can lead to surface degradation in the form of Leading Edge Erosion (LEE). As a consequence, the aerodynamic performance is affected, reducing the lift and increasing the drag by up to 53% and 314%, respectively. This can lead to a drop in Annual Energy Production (AEP) of
up to 3.7% In addition to the negative aerodynamic effects of LEE, it can also affect the aeroacoustic signature of the wind turbine, as the surface roughness can distort the boundary layer into becoming turbulent, thereby amplifying the self noise of the airfoil. A common complaint during the approval of a wind farm is the noise pollution experienced by surrounding communities. LEE develops overtime, the acoustic signature of the turbine at the beginning of its life cycle can be deemed acceptable by the community and regulatory agencies but can develop into unacceptable conditions. Quantifying the aeroacoustic effect of the wind turbine blade that has undergone erosion is of importance.
Therefore, this research investigated the following question: “Can leading edge erosion on wind turbine blades
be detected through its influence on aeroacoustic noise signatures?”
This study investigates the impact of leading edge erosion using the aeroacoustic wind tunnel facility at the University of Twente. Seven erosion models were placed on the DU97-W-300 airfoil to simulate the conditions of leading edge erosion without damaging the airfoil surface. The experiments were carried out at Reynolds numbers of 800,000, 700,000 and 600,000 at the maximum lift-to-drag ratio. Using a microphone array and beamforming techniques, the effect of leading edge erosion was measured. The research provides insights into the modeling of roughness under non-ideal scaling conditions and depicts the relation between the roughness-induced turbulent boundary layer and the aeroacoustic effects.

107642,Exploring the Improvement of Processes And Mediators Including The Effect of Person-Level Variables Post-Acceptance and Commitment Therapy,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107642,"This systematic literature review aimed to clarify how Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) works and for whom it is most effective. Guided by process-based therapy frameworks, the review synthesized evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to (1) identify which psychological processes are targeted by ACT, (2) determine which of these processes mediate treatment outcomes, and (3) examine whether person-level variables moderate ACT's effects. Consistent processes targeted by ACT were psychological flexibility, cognitive defusion, acceptance, and mindfulness, all appeared as a mediator in symptom reduction and functioning improvement. However, other core ACT processes (e.g., values, committed action, self-as-context) were under-investigated, leaving important theoretical assumptions untested. Notably, ACT did not consistently outperform cognitive or behavioral therapies on these process measures, raising concerns about treatment specificity and the role of shared therapeutic mechanisms. In terms of moderation, a limited number of baseline characteristics including higher fusion, depressive symptoms, and diagnostic status predicted greater process changes, though these did not reliably translate into superior clinical outcomes. These findings underscore both the empirical promise and current limitations of ACT research. To fully realize the potential of personalized, process-based therapy, future work should prioritize neglected ACT components, employ dismantling designs to test treatment specificity, and further investigate individual differences to support the development of more personalized, mechanism-informed interventions.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Embregts, L.",January 2025,English,"No

The core problem of the existence of case backlog is determined to be the presence of idle time in the hearing schedule – which is the leitmotif of this thesis. This is caused by the inflexibility of the hearing schedule that results in the inevitable scheduling of idle time when a buffer is needed.
Case backlog and corresponding waiting times should be reduced to a minimum as it has negative consequences for the work pressure of judges and clerks, and for the lives of justice seekers.
Based on the analysis of the current scheduling process and literature available concerning linear programming in the judicial system as well as in the broader service sector, we propose a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). The MILP is considered because the solution should provide integer outcomes and because earlier done research successfully applies this technique in hearing scheduling in the judicial system. The created MILP minimises the idle time between hearings by adjusting the hearing length – the number of cases that are batched in a hearing.",Bachelor Industrial Engineering & Management Science (B-IEM),"Greef, Leon de",July 2025,English,"No.

However, ongoing policy debates have introduced ambiguity and uncertainty in the higher education landscape. The reformulation of the internationalization policy prompts university students and employees to make sense of the policy shift and the concept of internationalization in higher education. Sensemaking is necessary for this study, as the reformulation disrupts routines of the university community. This study addresses the following research question: How do students and employees make sense of the reformulation of the internationalization policy within Dutch higher education? To answer this question, 30 semi-structured interviews were conducted at a Dutch university. Results
Participants interpreted internationalization in higher education as a multilayered and evolving concept through four main logics. The reformulation was widely viewed as politically driven and linked to other drivers including language policy laxity, housing shortages and national identity concerns. Participants expressed uncertainty of their futures, emotional distress, and anxiety, prior to the implementation of the reform. Conclusion
The research reveals that students and employees are actively making sense of the reformulation of internationalization policy in higher education.

This thesis investigates the optimisation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for real-time person detection on an STM32F7 microcontroller with a neuromorphic vision sensor, specifically Prophessee's GenX320. Neuromorphic vision sensors offer advantages such as low latency, low power consumption, and the preservation of the recorded's anonymity. However, they pose unique challenges for implementation with a CNN due to their event-based data rather than traditional frame-based outputs. The STM32F7 microcontroller also introduces limitations for CNN deployment, such as its limited internal RAM and Flash and a lack of dedicated hardware acceleration for CNN inference. This thesis reviews and implements various optimisation techniques, such as post-training quantisation, architectural simplification and input size reduction. These efforts aim to minimise resource usage while maintaining detection accuracy. Preexisting CNN models for person detection on RGB datasets like COCO were adapted to fit on the STM32F746G-DISCO's limited 1024 KB and 320 KB of internal RAM and Flash, respectively, alongside processes dedicated to the sensor and display. These optimised models were then trained for inference with a neuromorphic vision sensor using the PEDRo dataset. The applied improvements resulted in a model with an inference time of 422 ms and an AP of 75$\%$ (@0.5 IoU on the PEDRo dataset).

This scoping review synthesized current evidence on the characteristics, clinical applications, and reported outcomes of PP-IMIs in adults with psychological disorders.

Therefore, this thesis aims to optimise this structure by developing a BOHB (Bayesian Optimization and Hyperband) framework with the integration of LLaMA-based embeddings, identifying the most effective reward-tier strategies to enhance campaign success rates. The BOHB framework is specifically chosen, as it is particularly effective for high-dimensional, non-convex search spaces like those found in crowdfunding campaigns. Its adaptive resource allocation and multi-fidelity optimisation allow it to efficiently explore vast parameter spaces, identifying optimal reward strategies with reduced computational cost. To complement traditional numerical features such as funding goals, number of backers, and reward levels, the research integrates LLaMA embeddings which are incorporated in the model to predict the campaign success, giving a higher accuracy to the model. These embeddings capture the semantic richness and emotional tone of campaign descriptions and reward titles. By combining advanced hyperparameter optimisation with the use of LLaMA embeddings, the model identifies optimal reward configurations that enhance the probability of campaign success.
The study uses the publicly available Kickstarter database WebRobots.io, alongside additional data collected by a custom webscraper script. This thesis uses the data in the category Technology from the Kickstarter platform, followed by a data analysis in Python.

107616,A Dynamic Model for Landslide Early Warnings for the Road Network in Colombia,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107616,"Landslides routinely disrupt Colombia’s Andean road network, yet existing early-warning practice relies on fragmented event records and static rainfall thresholds. This thesis develops a dynamic, data-driven framework that links a unified landslide inventory with real-time precipitation forecasts to issue actionable road alerts. Eight national and regional catalogues were harmonised into a 17,824-event database (2000-2024). Spatial coverage was evaluated with kernel-density mapping; temporal completeness was quantified with a new Adjusted Temporal Units Completeness Score, revealing both well-documented hotspots and data gaps. A space-time Generalised Additive Model combines static predictors (slope, lithology, land cover, road class) with dynamic rainfall indices, antecedent totals, plus triggers from CHIRPS-GEFS. Cross-validation respecting spatial and temporal dependencies yields AUROC ≈ 0.75 and Brier ≈ 0.15, confirming operational suitability. A Youden-optimised probability threshold (0.30) feeds a traffic-light scheme that aggregates slope-unit probabilities into road-segment alerts. Back-testing on the January 2023 storm cluster captured 18 of 21 reported landslides and correctly highlighted affected road segments, while narrowing field action to manageable warning volumes. The study delivers (i) a quality-scored national inventory, (ii) a validated real-time landslide probability model, and (iii) an alert prototype ready for a road authority pilot deployment.

Objective circadian rhythm features were derived from 4-7 days of accelerometer data, with a daily wear time of more than 16 hours, collected from 392 participants. These features included the Relative Amplitude, Intradaily Variability, Interdaily Stability, Midline Estimated Statistic Of Rhythm, amplitude, and the acrophase. Participants were classified as experiencing heightened depressive symptoms or experiencing sleep disturbances via self-reported questionnaires. Multiple classification models were used to predict depression and sleep disturbances. The models were compared on several performance metrics. Removing equivocal zones improved metrics for all models. Plots of variable importance showed that the circadian rhythm features contributed minimally to both outcome predictions. No significant differences were found in circadian rhythm features between the depression group and the healthy controls; thus, no clear association was found between circadian rhythm disruptions and depression. Besides some significant differences in circadian rhythm features between the sleep disturbances group and the healthy controls, no other clear association was found between circadian rhythm disruptions and sleep disturbances.",Bachelor Biomedical Engineering (B-BMT),"Overmars, Nikki",July 2025,English,"No

Success in such procedures relies heavily on optimal trocar placement, which is complex, especially in robot-assisted surgery, and currently guided only by generic protocols. These do not account for individual abdominal shapes or the effects of pneumoperitoneum-induced distension. This thesis aims to enable personalized trocar placement by analyzing and simulating patient-specific abdominal wall distension. Using RGB-D cameras, 3D abdominal reconstructions were captured from 65 patients before and after insufflation. Displacement of ink landmarks marked by surgeons quantified distension, which had a mean of 3.6 ± 0.9 cm and varied significantly with age, height, and abdominal region. A simulation model using PointNeXt architecture was trained to predict distension from pre-insufflation shape and patient data. Neural ODEs generated deformation fields to supervise the model, achieving a Chamfer distance of 0.1 cm and a TRE of 0.8 cm. The PointNeXt model achieved 1.0 cm Chamfer distance and 1.6 cm TRE.

107607,Data envelopment analysis for project efficiency evaluation,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107607,"In today’s complex and resource-limited project environments, organizations face increasing challenges in selecting and managing projects efficiently. To address these issues, this study proposes a DEA-based evaluation framework designed to support early-stage project assessment and selection, allowing decision-makers to benchmark and prioritize projects before execution. The framework design was informed by a systematic literature review, which revealed that while DEA is widely used in sectors such as healthcare and education, its application to pre-project evaluation remains unexplored. It was developed in response to the limitations of traditional project evaluation methods, which often overlook the multi-dimensional nature of project efficiency by focusing on single metrics such as cost or financial outcome. By integrating multiple inputs and outputs, the DEA approach provides a comprehensive relative efficiency score for each project among other metrics which allows an objective comparison across projects. Additionally, we propose a set of key requirements for designing a DEA-based framework to support the selection and evaluation of early-stage projects. These requirements were derived from a review of relevant literature, practical considerations in project efficiency evaluation and the methodological constraints of DEA. To ensure practical relevance, we formulated KPI based on DEA results, incorporating inputs such as estimated costs, timelines, and resources alongside projected outputs like probabilities and financial outcomes. The study also compares CCR and BCC models for suitability in pre-execution contexts. A real-world case study validated the framework, demonstrating its ability to improve resource allocation, strategic alignment, and project evaluation. The developed KPIs bridge technical efficiency analysis and managerial decision-making. In conclusion, this research extends DEA use from retrospective to proactive project selection, laying the foundation for future improvements such as real-time data integration and automated decision-making to boost organizational project success and competitiveness.

To answer this, the study uses a qualitative research approach focusing on a single case study, namely that of Tuvalu, a Small Island Developing State of just 11,800 inhabitants in the Pacific Ocean. Two theoretical frameworks guide this analysis: Multi-Level Governance and Collaborative Governance. These frameworks assess how actors at different levels interact and how inclusive governance processes shape migration policy. The data collection draws on two main methods: i) a literature and policy analysis of scholarly articles and legal documents, for example, the Falepili Union Treaty, and ii) semi-structured interviews with experts who work within the Australian Government and the Tuvaluan Government. The findings show that both international agreements and domestic governance strategies can effectively enhance the capacity of Small Island Developing States to manage and plan for long-term sovereignty in the face of the existential threat of climate change.

For the purpose of the current study, the mixed-method framework by Andreotta et al. (2019) was employed and adapted into a qualitative research design for the study.  Drawing on existing research and the analysis of TikTok data, this study identified several patterns rooted in learned helplessness, hypervigilance and resilience. (1) Learned helplessness is the psychological state of powerlessness and a perceived inability to change one’s situation. (2) Hypervigilance describes a constant mental and emotional anticipation of racial discrimination and racism followed by a constant adaptation in self-presentation and performance.

This work investigates novel silicon gated PIN diodes fabricated in the CMOS 22FDX technology, focusing on their emission characteristics, electrical properties and possible applications. Optical and electrical measurements were completed, notably including emission spectra, responsivity, IV and gate characteristics. Emission over 600nm range with multiple peaks was observed, attributed to strong phonon replicas.  Quantum confinement in the structure led to the main emission peak at 1080nm, blue shifted 41meV from the bulk Si emission at 1120nm. Among the analysed variants the silicon germanium injector diodes were found the most efficient with emission further enhanced (up to two times) via electrostatic doping of the channel. These effect was investigated via the measurements and the technology computer-aided design simulations to understand the underlying physics. Emission efficiency was found too low for majority of the optical applications, but the unusually wide spectra extending to telecommunications wavelengths and the emission below silicon bandgap are unique properties, which could be still pursued in some applications.

Among many approaches to citizen participation, participatory budgeting (PB) became a well-recognised tool for increasing engagement between residents and local governance. PB, by encouraging collective action in local matters, enables the emergence of collaborative innovation (CI). However, various barriers may affect this feature of PB. This thesis’s goal is to analyse the underlying factors that affect the ability of PB to become a tool that supports CI in the city of Budapest, using a novel approach that broadens the academic understanding of PB. To explore the drivers and barriers, the research makes use of the theory of CI in the public sector set out by Sørensen and Torfing. The research relies on a qualitative case study analysis, inspecting secondary data on current PB tendencies, incorporating the analysis of relevant academic literature, public policy document examination and stakeholder interviews. Accordingly, the research is framed around the following main question: How does participatory budgeting facilitate or hinder CI in Budapest? The research highlights numerous barriers to collaboration, including the weak feedback provided to citizens and the systematic challenges caused by the financial crisis in Budapest.

While the SBW image has historically symbolized survival and strength, it often places a psychological burden on Black women, contributing to emotional isolation and burnout. This research specifically examines how Black women resist this schema through emotional expression, personal care prioritization, and community building.
Methods: A qualitative design was employed using reflexive thematic analysis. Data were extracted from publicly accessible Reddit posts and comments where Black women discussed their experiences with strength, vulnerability, and emotional well-being. These discussions occurred in subreddits such as r/BlackLadies, dedicated to Black women, where users either explicitly self-identified or engaged in conversations focused on Black women’s experiences. The analysis focused on capturing themes in how these users resist by challenging or redefining the SBW schema in their everyday lives. Ethical considerations included the use of only anonymized, publicly available data.
Results: The analysis revealed three major themes: Breaking Free from Silence, Choosing Myself Without Apology, and Healing Through Community. These themes illustrate how Black women on Reddit resist the SBW schema by expressing emotional vulnerability, setting personal boundaries, and finding validation through collective support. Particularly significant were reflections of burnout, intentional self-care practices, and the healing power of shared experiences within online communities.
Conclusion: This study shows that Black women use Reddit to resist the Strong Black Woman schema by challenging its emotional demands and reshaping what strength means in their everyday lives. The findings emphasize how digital spaces can foster care, connection, and culturally rooted forms of healing.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Pohl, V.P.",January 2024,English,"No.

This paper explores how RL agents can be trained to balance competitive racing performance with long-term efficiency in the high-fidelity racing simulator Assetto Corsa. Building on state-of-the-art Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) based frameworks, we extend both the observation space and reward function to include endurance metrics. Several agents are trained and evaluated on their ability to manage fuel and tire resources while maintaining speed across multi-lap sessions. Quantitative and observational analyses show that these methods play a crucial role in enabling efficient driving behaviors. A balanced agent improved fuel and tire wear efficiency by 22.6% and 10.5%, with realistic racing strategies such as lift and coast emerging spontaneously. However, trade-offs in lap time remain a challenge.

One type of widely used digital mental health intervention is e-mental health platforms. Previous research has identified barriers and facilitators to platform adoption, but how these perceived factors relate to healthcare professionals’ actual usage patterns is poorly understood. The aim of this mixed-methods study was to examine how mental healthcare professionals’ perceived barriers and facilitators relate to their actual usage patterns on DMHI platforms used by mental health organizations throughout the Netherlands. Log data was collected from three different DMHI platforms. This data was analysed using principal component analyses and cluster analyses to identify usage patterns. Additionally, semi-structured interviews of 11 professionals were analysed to gain more insight into platform usage, and perceived barriers and facilitators. The analyses revealed that two consistent user profiles emerged across all platforms: communication-focused users and administration-focused users. The platforms also revealed varying levels of usage intensity. The qualitative data identified barriers and facilitators that potentially play a role in the different usage patterns. Commonly identified barriers included technical issues. Facilitators included improved caseload management and client monitoring. However, barriers and facilitators may also emerge from usage patterns themselves, as professionals who frequently use certain features encounter barriers individuals using other features might not. The findings demonstrate future research should explore the relationship between usage patterns and therapeutic outcomes to determine which approaches are most effective for mental health professionals and clients, as well as how certain barriers and facilitators develop over time. Limitations of the study include the small qualitative interview sample and the inability to measure the effectiveness of different usage patterns.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Asselt, Leonie van",July 2025,English,"No.

107583,Mechanical Response of Saturated Soils Mixtures Under Freezing and Thawing Cycles,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107583,"This report aims to investigate the mechanical response of soil mixtures under freezing 
and thawing cycles, focusing on analysing the impacts on shear strength of freezing and 
thawing cycles in soils with different fine content.
The conclusion is found through an experimental campaign, subjecting each sample to a 
direct shear test before and after the freezing and thawing cycles. Two soil mixtures are 
analysed, one with 50% fine content and the other with 10% fine content, to see the 
differences in their behaviour after each cycle. During the sample preparation, it was seen 
that the samples with 50% clay presented inconsistent compressive behaviour, which 
caused a high variation in void ratio between samples, which could lead to an 
unpredictable result.
The study found that, after three thermal cycles, the mixtures with 10% fine content 
tended to increase slightly in shear strength, while the mixtures with 50% decreased their 
peak shear stress. Furthermore, in the mixture with less fine content, the soil tended to 
fail earlier as the FT cycles increased, but this behaviour was not seen in the other
mixtures. The finding also shows that the mixture with 10% fine content began to show 
changes in the soil's internal structure after the third cycle, whereas the changes were 
visible after the first cycle for the mixture with 50% clay.
Nevertheless, it was concluded that more research is necessary to fully support the results 
since it is necessary to analyse if the trend presented in the shear strength graphs will 
continue after the third cycle. Future research is also necessary to check whether the void 
ratio variation impacted the results.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Dagostin Zanatta, L.",June 2025,English,"No

107581,Evaluation of the BOS-Regge model,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107581,"The Netherlands is one of the most developed countries in terms of water safety. One of the ways they
maintain this safety is through numerous models that predict high waters. Waterschap Vechtstromen
also possesses one of these models, named FEWS Vecht. It is an operating model which controls several
underlying models of its main river and tributaries. The Bos Regge model represents one of the tributaries and exports its calculated data to FEWS Vecht. The Bos Regge model was constructed in 2022 for
application in FEWS Vecht. However, since then no investigation has been conducted on its reliability. It
therefore remains uncertain how to utilise the Bos Regge model.
Waterschap Vechtstromen is responsible for regulations during high-water situations. To regulate this as
best as possible, the waterboard would like to have a reliable model which can be operationally used in
FEWS Vecht.
This study focuses on improving the Bos Regge model and researching whether it can be operationally
used in FEWS Vecht. This will be done by comparing the current model with measurements of highwater situations and data from Waterschap Vechtstromen. The Bos Regge model is a SOBEK 2.15 model
consisting of two different modules: a hydrological module and a hydrodynamic module. The hydrological module uses the rainfall-runoff model of WALRUS, which calculates discharges from different
sub-catchments based on meteorological data. The model consists of various parameters, which impact
the behaviour of the peak discharges. How the different parameters impact those discharges will be analysed. The hydrodynamic model will be evaluated based on data available from the water board. These
are the database GEOWeb, the current NBW model, and the Atis regulation system for weirs.
During the study, it was concluded that the model which was made in 2022 contained several errors.
The main reason for this is that there have been no further adaptations since then. However, due to
regulations and adaptations, the water system has changed over the years. The changes in the water
system have been applied in the hydrodynamic model as realistically as possible. The input parameters
of the WALRUS model were generating peak discharge with the wrong behaviour. Due to the number
of parameters in the WALRUS model, there was no clear solution. Therefore, it was chosen not to take
into account parameters with minor impact, but only to analyse a selective group of parameters with
significant impact. Due to the shortage of measurement locations, not all the catchments could be analysed. All the adaptations to both modules have been combined and were compared to the measured
peak data.
To analyse the reliability of the model, several requirements from the operators of FEWS Vecht were set.
From that comparison, it turned out that the model didn’t fully meet the requirement to operate in FEWS
Vecht. Nevertheless, there was a significant improvement. To ensure that the Bos Regge model can be
used operationally in the future, it should be further investigated why the peak events did not meet the
requirements.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Lange, J.J.H. de",July 2025,English,"No.

107577,Long story short : Exploring the occurrence and effects of narrative strategies in book blurbs,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107577,"Purpose. A crucial facet of book marketing is the blurb, which aims to describe the plot and persuade the reader to purchase the book. However, knowledge regarding the blurb’s comprising narrative strategies, as well as the effects they elicit, is scarce. Additionally, book marketing employs narrative transportation, which appears when the reader is absorbed in the narrative. Narrative transportation is noted to occur in movies and books, although its appearance in blurbs is yet unrevealed. Through two types of research, this study aimed to explore the narrative strategies occurring in book blurbs within the Young Adult genre, additionally inquiring the effects these strategies elicit regarding narrative transportation, attitude, and purchase intention.
Method. Research 1 investigated the appearing narrative strategies in blurbs through a content analysis. Two narrative strategies, Perspective and Worldbuilding, were selected for research 2, which consisted of an experiment. The experiment examined the possible occurrence of narrative transportation as well as the effects provoked on attitude and purchase intention.
Results. The content analysis revealed that blurbs maintained consistent with their purpose, to describe the plot, as frequently occurring narrative strategies centred around plot aspects. Concerning series, the majority of the codes occurred equally among series or solely in sequels. Further, the majority of the codes were applied in the Fantasy sub-genre. The experiment produced insignificant results for narrative transportation, attitude, and purchase intention, with marginal differences between Perspective and Worldbuilding.
Conclusion. This study obtained insights into the narrative strategies occurring in Young Adult blurbs and the effects that strategies Perspective and Worldbuilding elicit. The findings provide a guideline for authors and publishers who desire a concept on how to write blurbs in the Young Adult genre, albeit this study highlights the liberty the writing process could possess regarding the utilisation of narrative strategies, since the contrast in their effects is insignificant.",Master Communication Science (M-COM),"Oude Heuvel, Nicole J.

This thesis explores how EI is expressed through both verbal and non-verbal behaviour. While EI is widely studied, most research relies on self-report measures that overlook the complexity of real interactions. This study uses qualitative, semi-structured interviews with professionals in interpersonal roles to uncover how EI is enacted in practice. Findings show that emotionally intelligent behaviours are often unconscious and context-dependent. Participants highlighted actions such as reflective questioning, empathetic tone, affirming gestures, and adaptive communication as signs of EI. These fall into three dimensions: verbal expression, non-verbal signals, and their dynamic interplay. By framing EI as a behavioural process rooted in communication, this research moves beyond trait-based models. It shows how individuals co-regulate emotions in real-time through speech, tone, and embodied presence. The study proposes EI as a set of learnable and observable behaviours, offering a foundation for coaching, recruitment, and organisational development.

Given its harmful effects, developing strategies to mitigate its spread is essential. One such strategy is to identify key contributors of hate speech on social media. By developing a practical framework for this purpose, policymakers and others alike can gain access to tools that provide deeper insights into the matter. Thus, this paper presents an approach that combines BERT, a powerful Natural Language Processing model, and PageRank, a well-documented and foundational ranking algorithm, to identify influential users in the spread of hate speech on Reddit. When applied to Reddit data from the 2024 U.S. Presidential election, it showed that the dissemination of hate speech was being driven by a central core group of users — users who are often the most active and connected to other influential users. Additionally, thematic analysis via TF-IDF combined with K-Means clustering proved semi-successful in uncovering dominant themes, including immigration, identity politics, and geopolitics.

It is labor-intensive, as testers must gather intelligence, plan exploits, interact with interfaces, and document actions precisely. Recent advances in language models (LLMs) have spurred efforts to automate parts of this workflow. Studies show LLM agents can generate commands, interpret tool output, and chain tasks, yet they lack programmatic control over a web browser. That omission limits their ability to test client-side logic critical in web applications. We explore whether adding browser access to LLM-driven agents closes that gap. We build two agents: a command-line baseline and a browser-enabled variant that can click, type, read the DOM, and monitor network traffic. Both are evaluated on twenty-seven Web Security labs covering nine common web vulnerabilities. The browser-enabled agent solves 66.7 percent of the labs, compared to 40.7 percent for the baseline, expands coverage from three to seven vulnerability classes, and shows the biggest gains on medium-difficulty tasks. These results confirm that giving agents control over a web browser is a significant advance for automated penetration testing.

Currently, the National Vulnerability Database already provides developers with a publicly available database containing known vulnerabilities, but CVEs are identified manually, and many of their associated TTPs are missing. This means that despite developers being aware of vulnerabilities, it is difficult to address them. To address this problem, a tool was developed in this research that identifies vulnerabilities in a GitHub repository.

107565,Tailor-made Breathing : Mixed-Methods Study on Tailoring a Virtual Reality Breathing Exercise for Versatile Applications,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107565,"The current study investigated how system-controlled tailoring should be combined with virtual reality (VR) breathing interventions and its impact on subjective vitality and motivation as this is an understudied topic. It was hypothesised that the experimental (tailored) group would experience higher subjective vitality and motivation. Perception of tailoring was explored with a focus on personal relevance, motivators, and barriers. A convergent parallel mixed-methods experimental design with permuted block randomisation was conducted. Overall, a pretest-posttest of subjective vitality and motivation, and an inductive semi-structured interview was employed with 38 participants, 18 in the experimental group (M_age=22.1, SD_age=2.6) and 20 in the control group (M_age=24.6, SD_age=2.4). Data analysis included an independent samples t-test, 2x2 RM-ANOVA, a linear mixed model, and thematic analysis. The results revealed no significant quantitative difference in subjective vitality and motivation within or between groups. However, almost double the number of participants in the control group mentioned a desire for a form of adaptation to increase personal relevance and motivation. None of the experimental group was allocated to level 1, and some reported a discrepancy between their skill level and the breathing exercise. The present study contributed to development and knowledge in VR breathing interventions by proposing a system-controlled method of tailoring as a standardised method is missing from current literature. The results revealed potential to explore the accuracy of the screening tool, and consider the interoceptive awareness, preferences, and gender of participants, which were not considered currently.

107564,Self Organised Criticality and Avalanche Detection in Neural Networks,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107564,"In the domain of Machine Learning, which deals with algorithms that are designed to extract
patterns from data that is fed to them, Neural Networks (NN) are a fundamental tool for tackling
complex problems that may require higher levels of pattern recognition22. They require a large
amount of data to be trained as compared to other methods and are relatively expensive to both
train and operate. However, their ability to learn tasks that are mainly associated with human
capabilities and depending on the context, being able to outperform human cognition makes
them the choice of method for some domains29.
NNs are what would be considered a Black-box system, yielding minimum information about
the purpose and the structure of the neurons within them25. By their design, the influence that
the neurons have on each other will form according to the training data and in an unpredictable
fashion. This leads to neurons forming groups among themselves to achieve a particular step in
the processing of its input, where their purpose in the overall system will not be immediately
explainable to an outside observer.
The Black-box nature of the NNs causes them to be tough to evaluate for reliability and
faults. This secretive nature means that certain components of the decision process (for cases
where the decisions need multiple stages of reasoning to achieve) can not be tested individually,
only the system as a whole. That means that the whole system can not be theoretically proven to
be reliable and, only be assessed as far as the testing data allows. This fact raises large concerns
for applications that are safety-critical, such as the automotive and the health industries27.
One of the factors that hinder the reliability of NNs is the naturally occurring state of
criticality8. This state increases the likelihood of the system to change its state with very
minimal outside influence, making the system highly sensitive. Having the neurons set up in
such a way that would result in critical behaviour, they get a chance to get the rest of the neurons
to fire in a cascading manner, with their numbers of activations following a power-law. Naturally,
when this kind of behaviour is not designed into the system, such disturbances can have negative
effects on their performance. We aim to reduce the number of these disturbances in a system by
analyzing the underlying structure which may lead to such behaviors and potentially devising a
method in which the structure can be modified to minimize the effect of them.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Akin, Tayfun",July 2025,English,"No.

However, applications differ in their data representation and use of motivational strategies to support goal achievement. This paper presents an ontology that formally represents key concepts such as user, goals, session, and feedback within running tracking applications. The ontology is based on an analysis of 10 popular Android running applications and is designed to address gaps in how applications use personalization and motivation to support user engagement. A literature review revealed that no existing ontologies specifically target running applications, leaving a gap in formally capturing concepts related to them. To address this gap, the developed ontology offers a structured and extensible model that supports the representation of user behaviour and goal setting.

were answered by analysing existing literature and conducting interviews. Based on existing 
literature, it was suspected that feelings of insecurity caused by terror attacks decrease young 
people’s trust in the government and increase support for populism. The main findings were 
that, in general, there is a feeling of insecurity due to the attacks among the German youth, 
which is a factor driving the decrease in trust in the government. Furthermore, while factors 
influencing declining trust in the government overlap with those increasing support for 
populism, emotional and moral motivations are especially important drivers of populist support.","Bachelor Management, Society and Technology (B-MST)","Knoechlein, Lena",June 2025,English,"No

This study evaluates the applicability of the Informer architecture, a state-of-the-art transformer model for long-sequence forecasting, on longitudinal clinical data from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Multiple model variations are explored, including different temporal embedding techniques, feature selection strategies, and multi-task learning configurations. To enhance clinical interpretability, explainability methods such as self-attention visualizations, permutation importance, and GradientSHAP are employed.

107558,The relation between crises and the rise of populism : a study about the housing crisis in the Netherlands,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107558,"This thesis examines the extent to which the Dutch housing crisis has contributed to a rise in populist tendencies among starters (young adults aged 18- to 34). While populist voting is often attributed to cultural backlash among older generations, this study finds that economic exclusion has been the catalysator for populism among starters. Combining textual analysis with electoral and demographic data, this study applies a mixed-methods approach within a single-country case study design.
The findings indicate that starters are disproportionately affected by the housing crisis due to lower incomes and limited access to property ownership. Although populist parties commonly frame the crisis as a consequence of mass immigration, starters remain the most accepting towards migrants. Nevertheless, a higher increase in populist voting was observed among starters compared to older generations.
These results challenge the cultural backlash thesis and suggest that economic stress – rather than cultural backlash – is a stronger motivator of populist sentiment among Dutch starters. This thesis concludes that the housing crisis functions as a catalyst for political disaffection, supporting Rodrik’s (2018) theory of economic backlash.","Bachelor Management, Society and Technology (B-MST)","Salm, M. van der",June 2025,English,"No

This study compared two age groups from the ages of 18-30 and 50-70.
            The main question is whether the perceptions of asylum policies and asylum seekers lead to different amounts of trust in the government. The study expected that the younger generation, who often have more contact with asylum seekers and use social media, may have more positive perceptions and better trust. On the other hand, older people rely more on traditional media, which results in a more critical view. To explore this, this research used a mixed-methods approach, conducting six interviews and looking at policy documents and case studies. The results showed that trust in the government is an important factor in whether people think asylum policies are fair and transparent. With younger people often wanting more inclusiveness and open communication, and the older generation often focusing more on consistency and fairness.

107555,How do Mediterranean managers fill in their leadership role in the Netherlands?,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107555,"In recent years, heightened migration has increased cultural diversity in Western European societies. This demographic shift has impacted the workforce, making bicultural leadership styles increasingly relevant as immigrants bring diverse perspectives into professional settings. While previous research has examined cultural tensions and adaptation of ethnic minorities in operational roles Waldring, Crul, and Ghorashi, 2014), limited empirical attention has been given to how bicultural individuals lead. This study aims to fill this gap by providing in-depth empirical insights into how Mediterranean managers, specifically of Turkish and Moroccan descent, fill in their leadership roles in the Netherlands. Drawing on 16 semi-structured interviews with Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch managers, this qualitative study applies the Critical Incident Technique (CIT) to explore how cultural values such as respect, authority, and community orientation interact with Dutch workplace expectations of consensus, autonomy, and direct feedback. The findings reveal that these managers develop a bicultural leadership style, blending Mediterranean trait with Dutch norms of egalitarianism and open communication. Notably, the study challenges traditional acculturation models by demonstrating that adaptation does not occur uniformly but varies by characteristic and situation. Mediterranean managers show high adaptability, yet selectively retain core values rooted in their cultural upbringing.

It includes creating a dashboard proof of concept to support outpatient clinic planning. The study is conducted at Saxenburgh, a general hospital in the Netherlands, and follows the Design Science Methodology. Interviews with internal stakeholders and experts at 8 organizations revealed five primary challenges in operational capacity management: insufficient planning insights, underutilization of patient forecasts, limited cross-departmental visibility, low dashboard adoption, and staffing misalignments. Hospital staff emphasized the need for dashboards that provide timely insights into capacity, scheduling, and interdepartmental effects. A prototype dashboard for outpatient clinics planning was developed that displays appointment fill rates, waiting lists, and operating room utilization. Three iterative feedback sessions with users ensured that the dashboard aligns with daily routines and practical needs. The results show that dashboards are most effective when they are simple, built collaboratively, and embedded into existing workflows. Based on these findings, the study offers five practical recommendations: keep designs simple, begin small and start with a focused use case, ensure data quality, minimize access barriers, and involve end users throughout development.

To enhance the effectiveness of these mindfulness apps, this study investigates the independent and combined effects of guidance and personalisation on the reduction of anxiety and depression symptoms. The research question: “Does the inclusion of personalisation and guidance in mobile mental health interventions with mindfulness lead to greater improvements in the effectiveness of therapy compared to mindfulness-only interventions for individuals with anxiety and depression?”. This is realised by conducting a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of 45 RCTs of mindfulness‑based mobile apps, calculating within‑group Hedges’ g and performing a between-group meta-analysis. Covariate effects are accounted for as well (age, gender, clinical status, comorbidity). Mindfulness‑only apps significantly reduced both depression and anxiety, the inclusion of guidance further enhanced the impact on depression, and combined guidance and personalisation improved both anxiety and depression symptoms.

107545,A Lasting Paradigm Shift? : The EU’s Approach to Sustainable Development after the European Green Deal,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107545,"Since the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, sustainable development (SD) has been progressively embedded within the EU's policy portfolio. The most comprehensive approach for enhancing SD is the European Green Deal (EGD) which represents a shift in the EU’s SD discourse as it prioritises the environmental pillar of SD and frames economic and social measures as conductive to overarching environmental objectives. This novel approach signifies a paradigm shift, thereby empowering pro-environmental actors. However, following the EGD’s adoption, new, notably conservative, actors entered the EU institutions, resulting in a recalibration of power relations. This thesis investigates whether the prioritisation of the environmental pillar of SD prevailed after the EGD. A critical discourse analysis of the EU’s key strategies after the 2024 European Parliament elections reveals that the paradigm of the EGD did not prevail. This is evidenced by a shift in both the extent to which environmental measures are emphasised in the SD discourse, and a shift in the manner environmental, social, and economic measures are integrated. This shift is characterised by a prioritisation of economic measures over environmental ones. Consequently, economic growth and competitiveness are framed as key objectives in the EU’s SD discourse, thereby empowering actors in the economic field.","Bachelor Management, Society and Technology (B-MST)","Baars, Thies",June 2025,English,"No.

A systematic evaluation framework was developed and applied using both publicly available documentation and survey responses from one traditional financial institution and one alternative finance institution. Findings reveal that neither institution fully complies with all aspects of the FAIR principles. Both traditional banks and P2P lending platforms perform well in Findability and basic Interoperability. However, significant differences arise in Accessibility. While traditional banks benefit from regulatory frameworks, their internal practices lag in areas such as open protocols and durable metadata storage, resulting in a lower alignment with Accessibility. In contrast, P2P lending platforms show stronger internal alignment with Accessibility through the use of open protocols and durable metadata infrastructure. Reusability remains a challenge for both sectors, primarily due to incomplete systematic provenance tracking. The study concludes that while traditional banks benefit from regulatory frameworks and established governance structures, P2P lending platforms may be ahead in some aspects of FAIR alignment, particularly in internal Accessibility. The research highlights the importance of harmonized standards and suggests targeted improvements for both sectors to enhance FAIR compliance.",Master Business Information Technology (M-BIT),"Koerselman, Noah",July 2025,English,"No

a demonstrated high mechanical advantage. Using this design as inspiration, a new rongeur was designed from the ground up, with cleanability integrated as a key requirement from the start. Requirements were derived and several ideas explored; a ratchet mechanism was selected and developed further. A new type of rotational joint was designed, providing at least 1 mm clearance to enable effective cleaning.

Existing literature has examined defence integration through institutional or strategic lenses; the thesis differentiates by focusing on how political willingness is expressed through discourse in national politics. The study conducts a discourse analysis through a theory-testing approach of Dutch parliamentary and media debates from January 2018 until May 2025, through an operationalization of three hypotheses based on neo-realist and neo-functionalist theory. The findings reveal a shift: Before 2022, Dutch discourse was dominated by a realist logic of NATO reliance, while post-2022 discourse increasingly reflects support, but notably constrained, for EU-level defence cooperation. The thesis concludes that political willingness within the Netherlands is increasing but that it remains conditional, as concerns over autonomy and fiscal burden sharing within the EU persist.

This study explores the impact of blockchain technology on efficiency and security in migration management, focusing on the German FLORA project initiated by the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, which introduces blockchain as a means to improve data practices concerning asylum processes. The aim of this research is to build upon existing research to critically investigate the effects of the implementation of blockchain on migration management processes. The multidisciplinary theoretical framework includes theories regarding effects of data on migration management and applying cybersecurity concepts in public administration. A qualitative content analysis was conducted on FLORA project documentation, with a codebook developed to reflect the theoretical framework. Results indicate that blockchain implementation positively transformed efficiency of migration management, for example because structured and traceable data practices allowed data to be organized more efficiently.

107535,Can You Spot the Hidden Message? : Enhancing Mobile Privacy with Image Steganography,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107535,"As technology has rapidly advanced over the last decades, increasing threats have endangered people’s privacy. While methods for hiding message content are widely used, techniques for concealing metadata such as who is communicating, when, or how have often been overlooked. One approach that aims to take a step in that direction is Image Steganography, the practice of hiding secret information within images. The research conducted by Dodeja (2022) has led to the development of “BaatCheet”, a mobile messaging application that allows users to send secret messages embedded in pictures. This allows users to hide the message content and obscures the act of communication itself. The author uses a technique called LSB embedding to modify the pixels of the cover image. While basic LSB substitution is computationally efficient and easy to implement, it is also the most vulnerable to image steganalysis. More advanced variants like LSB matching provide improved resistance by introducing less noticeable modifications to the cover image. This research aims to explore steganographic embedding techniques such as LSB matching, edge-adaptive embedding, and matrix embedding. First, the research will experiment with LSB matching alone, then pair it with matrix embedding and edge-based embedding separately and finally combine all three. Each of these configurations will represent a distinct embedding system. Every configuration will be evaluated based on embedding and extraction time, extraction reliability, embedding capacity, and robustness against steganalysis. The paper aims to develop an embedding system suitable for use in a mobile messaging application.

As face recognition systems become increasingly prevalent, their vulnerability to morphing attacks has become a relevant topic of discussion. An example of a morphing attack is in airports, with some countries permitting the release of electronic Machine Readable Travel Documents with photos submitted by the applicant which are subsequently approved or rejected. By examining ways to avert morphing attacks (i.e., techniques to reject or accept an image), this paper proposes a system that considers how various image quality properties may influence morph rejection. The threshold used in the decision-making process, as well as the final prediction score, is based on image quality properties combined with the prediction score given by a face recognition system. In doing so, the possible relationship between an image’s quality properties, its similarity score, and BRISQUE is investigated.

107518,Extracting Indicators of Compromise from Threat Reports by Leveraging the Power of LLMs,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107518,"Current advancements in cybersecurity often aim at facilitating the
search and identification of vulnerabilities. These include Indicators
of Compromise (IOCs), which serve as data artifacts that can be easily
targeted/used with the intention of exploiting said systems. Cyber
Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports are produced by cybersecurity teams
with the expectation of exposing vulnerabilities in a given security
framework. The act of exposing these vulnerabilities includes extract-
ing IOCs. These indicators are commonly extracted from CTI reports
by using what are known as rule-based extraction tools. However,
these tools have limitations as they only extract known and correctly
structured IOC types, causing them to overlook other potential indica-
tors. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest
that these tools can be used to extract IOCs from CTI reports. This re-
search explores the current differences between rule- and LLM-based
extraction with expectations of understanding the difference in per-

While there are methods for 2D segmentation using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and 3D segmentation using 3D models, the complementary nature of 2D data and 3D data should not be ignored. This research investigates multimodal fusion of 2D images and 3D LiDAR point clouds for semantic segmentation in structured and unstructured environments. Building on the DeepViewAgg framework, we aim to investigate the impact of feature fusion on semantic segmentation compared to 2D- and 3D-only models. The methodology involves training a model for each modality and evaluating its performance. On KITTI-360, fusion improves mean IoU from 54.20 (3Donly) and 56.70 (2D-only) to 57.53, with the largest gain on thin classes such as ’pole’ (+21.3 points). In the WildScenes natural dataset, it achieves 33.0 mIoU, outperforming 2D and 3D baselines with a margin of 5.0 points.

LLM-based type alignment refers to an LLM selecting a matching pair of entities between two knowledge graphs, where the entities are types instead of specific instances, to determine whether under-resourced languages form a factor in the performance of type alignment. For this, perturbations (simulating sparse attribute information, incomplete coverage, reduced granularity and other structural inconsistencies) are inflicted into a knowledge graph extracted from Wikidata, and alignment is tested for different languages. The findings show that the overall alignment performance is minimally affected by different languages for the different perturbations. However, for the incorrect pairings made, the amount of hallucinations in an under-resourced language are larger, indicating less stability for difficult to align pairs and a lesser robustness to failure handling in an under-resourced language. These findings point to an area of potential in alignment failure investigation for LLM-based approaches, focusing on typographical and character-based perturbations, as these manipulations were found to have a more detrimental effect on alignment performance than semantic alterations.",Bachelor Technical Computer Science (B-TCS),"Karkalasev, Filip",July 2025,English,"No

challenge of class imbalance, where default cases are significantly underrep-

techniques like Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and
Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) are commonly applied prior to
the use of ML models for credit risk assessments. However, the impact of
these methods on both predictive performance and fairness is underexplored.
This thesis investigates how synthetic data balancing techniques influence
model accuracy and fairness in credit risk datasets. Using open-source data,
classifiers such as logistic regression (LR) and XGBoost are evaluated with
standard metrics including area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), precision,
recall, and F1 score. Fairness is assessed using Equalized Odds, Demographic
Parity, and Disparate Impact Ratio (DIR). Results show that while both bal-
ancing techniques modestly improve the predictive performance of logistic
regression, their effect on XGBoost is minimal. Importantly, both methods
contribute to reduced fairness disparities between genders, supporting more

One of these methods is the post-training compression technique 'singular value decomposition', which approximates a weight matrix with smaller matrices. To avoid the necessity of extensive retraining, the paper proposes a dynamic implementation of the same mathematical concept, which starts training with full-size decomposed matrices and prunes itself during training. Through batched pruning and a relaxed orthogonality constraint, the final system effectively decreases model size during training while increasing overall accuracy.",Bachelor Technical Computer Science (B-TCS),"Stribos, W.H.",July 2025,English,"No

Applications include vehicle monitoring or product and inventory counting. Count approaches are split between class-specific, which localize instances of a predetermined object, and class-agnostic, for open-world, flexible scenarios.  Recent developments in transformer-based, class-agnostic counters are trained on image pairs and text prompts that include class names and predict an object-specific density map. Although such methods generally produce feasible results, real-world imagery rarely portrays a uniform or predictable distribution of specific objects. Humans can count objects given a non-standardized set of images, such as different perspectives, color hue, or proximity to the sensor and in most environmental conditions, instead of rigidly-framed settings. A benchmark on how deep learning models test under the specified mixed cluttered scenes has not been done yet. Our benchmark aims to fill the knowledge gap under aforementioned stressed conditions.

traditional DBSCAN for its ability to handle varying cluster densities,
noisy data, and high-dimensional embeddings produced by BERT. Cluster
boundaries are further refined using an algorithm that separates overlapping
clusters to delineate target categories clearly.

However, current task management practices at the Boekelosebleekgaard food forest in Enschede are informal and fragmented, often leading to task duplication, missed responsibilities, and reduced volunteer engagement. This thesis explores how spatiotemporal information visualization can facilitate more effective task management in such environments. A literature review was conducted to identify visualization techniques best suited for event-based spatiotemporal data, leading to the design and development of a task manager prototype tailored to the forest’s needs. Using an iterative UI/UX methodology, the prototype incorporated interactive event maps and temporal filters and was evaluated through two rounds of user testing with forest participants. Feedback highlighted improved spatial awareness, clarity of task timelines, and usability. The findings demonstrate that spatiotemporal visualization can significantly enhance task coordination in community-managed agricultural projects, particularly when paired with user-centered design.

Our multi-perspective analysis reveals that a one-size-fits-all approach to calibration is insufficient. We demonstrate that simple methods like Temperature Scaling are unreliable and can completely fail on certain architectures, whereas flexible non-parametric and composite methods provide statistically significant improvements in calibration. The composite Dirichlet-Isotonic method consistently proves to be the most effective and robust choice, successfully correcting complex, architecture-specific error patterns. Furthermore, our work uncovers critical trade-offs, such as the potential to improve average calibration error (ECE) at the cost of worst-case error (MCE), highlighting the need for careful assessment.

It has been shown by previous research that, as these graphs grow in size (node/state count), the probability of truth of any given CTL formula converges to a fixed value. This paper focuses on a gap in the current research, which is determining how fast this convergence occurs. The paper demonstrates how the convergence happens very quickly, at graph sizes not exceeding a few hundred nodes even for very complex CTL formulae. This greatly impacts model checking because graph sizes of tens thousands of nodes are typically used. Since it has been shown how to calculate the convergence probabilities by previous research, and we now know that these probabilities are converged to very quickly, this phenomenon can be exploited by model checkers by probabilistically guessing whether a given formula holds for a model instead of actually verifying whether it does. The paper also shows that the convergence happens exponentially, and the pattern of how graph generation parameters (probability of edges occurring, probability of states being labeled as initial) also affect the rate of convergence.",Bachelor Technical Computer Science (B-TCS),"Timofeev Fornasov, Denis",June 2025,English,"No

107455,Using LLMs as Assistants for Maintaining Rule-Based IOC Extractor Tools,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107455,"Indicators of compromise (IOCs) are forensic artifacts, such as malicious IP addresses, URLs, file hashes, or malware names, that signal a likely system breach. Accurate detection and extraction of such indicators from open threat reports is crucial for timely defense, as delays in identifying IOCs can lead to missed opportunities to contain or mitigate a threat on time. Rapid IOC recognition enables real-time alerts, automated blocking, and faster incident response. Traditionally, open-source tools and research prototypes rely on hand-crafted regular expressions (regex) and rule-based extractors to identify IOCs in text. This constraint is problematic as human analysts face an overwhelming volume of unstructured reports. These static patterns struggle with variable threat report syntax, obfuscation (e.g., defanged URLs),
and novel IOC formats.
Recent advancements in AI, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer powerful natural language understanding that can identify entities and relationships in text. By leveraging LLMs to suggest or adapt regex patterns based on new threat reports, we aim to increase IOC coverage and adaptability while reducing manual effort.
This paper concludes that, when augmented with gemma3:27b-generated regexes, the rule-based extractor’s average recall jumps from 37.9% to 69.1% and its F1 score climbs from 41.0% to 55.3%, while precision increases modestly from 46.6% to 50.4%. By contrast, the smaller Regex-AI-Llama-3.2-1B:F16 model yielded only marginal gains (mean recall 39.2%, F1 32.6%).
These results show that larger LLMs can substantially broaden IOC coverage,
yet the broader patterns they generate can introduce false positives. As a result, maintaining high extractor reliability in a dynamic threat landscape still depends on a human-in-the-loop workflow to review and refine LLM-suggested rules.",Bachelor Technical Computer Science (B-TCS),"Milev, Konstantin",July 2025,English,"No.

107445,Comparative Study of Trace Clustering and Process Cube Sequences in Process Mining,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107445,"One of the key challenges that process mining often encounters is “spaghetti-like” process models generated in process discovery due to complex variants of the event data. To address this, segmentation techniques such as trace clustering and Process Cube analysis have been proposed. This study presents a comparative benchmark of these two approaches, both individually and in combination, applied to the 4TU Sepsis Cases event log. By segmenting the data using trace clustering, Process Cube, Process Cube followed by trace clustering (Process Cube → trace clustering), and trace clustering followed by Process Cube (trace clustering → Process Cube), the resulting process models are evaluated through complexity metrics such as Cyclomatic Number, Coefficient of Network Connectivity, and arc density. The results show that the Process Cube → trace clustering combination produces the most simplified and interpretable process models. The result also suggests that dimension-based segmentation provides a more effective segmentation for further clustering. This work focuses on the segmentation order and provides a methodological basis for applying appropriate techniques to improve model quality in process discovery.",Bachelor Business Information Technology (B-BIT),"Park, Byeonghun",July 2025,English,"No

As a case study, the European Train Control System (ETCS), a critical rail safety system increasingly vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, serves as a case study. The MLAFG integrates attack graphs with multi-level system abstraction to capture four fundamental interaction types: mutual reinforcement, antagonism, conditional dependence, and independence. This study extends formal definitions for these interactions and proposes methods for visual syntax analysis and selective representation. A visual critique grounded in the Physics of Notation is presented, alongside a novel importance score for high-level attack nodes that enables abstraction through selective representation.

Meanwhile, vulnerabilities in IoT systems have become increasingly prevalent. Despite this, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database, a key resource in cybersecurity, does not explicitly indicate whether a vulnerability is related to IoT. Previous studies primarily rely on keyword-based searches and manual review to identify IoT-related vulnerabilities, which is time-consuming and may fail to capture more nuanced cases. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in classifying CVEs as IoT-related or not and compare their performance against fine-tuned Natural Language Processing (NLP) based classifiers. We then investigate which specific components of a CVE entry, such as the description or affected items, contribute most significantly to the classification decision, providing insights into the internal decision-making process of the LLMs. Our goal is to go beyond simple keyword detection, reduce manual work, and expand the current datasets of IoT vulnerabilities. Results show that LLMs have high potential in automatically classifying CVEs with an accuracy of 92% without any fine-tuning or the need for labeled training data.

This vast reach raises critical concerns about the spread of hate, which now occurs at an unprecedented rate and affects millions of people globally. Hateful messages circulate daily across numerous platforms, impacting a wide range of social groups. Much of this content is closely tied to politics, conflicts, and global events that serve as catalysts for the amplification of hate. Reddit, in particular, stands out as a prominent platform for political discourse and news sharing. This paper introduces an interactive dashboard designed to visualize the spread of hate speech on Reddit. The dashboard enables users to upload datasets, filter them by subreddit, flairs, and time period, and explore the raw data through interactive time-series and influence graphs. Our main contributions are threefold: (i) a novel system for analyzing the temporal dynamics of hate speech, (ii) a module for identifying influential users, and (iii) new insights into the patterns of content propagation through cross-post and domain analysis.

The FAIR principles were designed to provide a framework for improving data quality and reuse. However, current accreditation practices show limited alignment. This study investigates how centralised and decentralised data architectures could support FAIR-compliant accreditation systems in the event industry. Three existing comparison frameworks are discussed to assess their suitability for this purpose. The results indicate that while these frameworks highlight necessary design trade-offs, none fully address the operational, legal, and stakeholder-specific needs of event accreditation systems. Based on the results, five design considerations are proposed.

protocols, focusing on optimizing clinical outcomes, healthcare costs, and
patient well-being. Our formal modelling approach compares a preventive
protocol (based on KIMO guidelines) versus a symptomatic protocol. Results
demonstrated that the preventive protocol leads to a slightly higher average

average incidence of complications per patient was marginally higher under
the preventive protocol (1.64 vs. 1.63), but complication rates per extraction
were comparable between the protocols. Notably, severe complications such
as alveolitis trended lower under the preventive approach (33.9% vs. 44.4%).
The preventive protocol also reduced average healthcare costs per patient

This hinders systematic understanding and synthesis of findings across studies. In this work, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the classification of academic papers related to TFP using a validated semantic taxonomy.
We present a structured classification pipeline that integrates prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and schema-based output formatting. Two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Flash, are evaluated on a curated dataset of 23 papers using macro-F1 scores and inter-rater agreement with expert annotations. To assess robustness, each model is tested across repeated runs and under both RAG-enabled and non-retrieval settings.
Our results show that RAG substantially improves classification accuracy in nuanced dimensions such as modeling constraints and objective structure. While model performance varies across tasks, both LLMs demonstrate strong generalization to papers outside operations research, including those without formal mathematical models. However, consistency issues remain in abstract categories like evolution, highlighting the need for improved prompt calibration and system-level refinement.
This study provides evidence that LLMs, when guided by structured inputs and targeted context, can support scalable and interpretable classification in complex academic domains.

This systematic review examines literature from 2021 to identify emerging
research dimensions and derive implications for future clinical practice and
research directions. Following systematic screening of 316 articles, 34 studies
met inclusion criteria for analysis.
Result found that the most focused dimension in 2021 is ’when’, counted

While previous research has largely emphasized individual-level outcomes and user experiences, little is known about how these gardens relate to neighborhood-scale well-being indicators and whether their spatial distribution serves communities with the potential need. To address this gap, this study explores the spatial associations between community gardens and neighborhood-level well-being in Overijssel, the Netherlands.
Three primary objectives structured the research. First, spatial characteristics reflecting gardens’ social and ecological functions were selected based on a literature review and available spatial data. Garden size, size per capita, vegetation health (NDVI), public transport accessibility, walking and cycling accessibility, and garden location are the selected qualities. Patterns were mapped using kernel density and spatial autocorrelation analyses, revealing that gardens are predominantly situated in rural neighborhoods and densely populated municipalities, particularly Zwolle and Steenwijkerland.
Second, neighborhood-level well-being indicators were compiled from reliable statistical sources, resulting in 27 measurable variables, to operationalize the Statistics Netherlands well-being  framework. Hotspot analyses and comparative statistics highlighted significant urban-rural differences, with rural areas consistently displaying better overall well-being. Further statistical analysis found rural neighborhoods with community gardens exhibit notably higher resilience, social cohesion, and physical activity levels than those without. T his spatial distribution of gardens suggests that they tend to be located in areas already characterized by higher well-being, indicating that neighborhoods with potentially greater needs and lower well-being indicators may be underserved by existing community gardens.
Third, associations between garden qualities and neighborhood well-being were examined using Kendall’s rank correlation and Local Bivariate Relationship analysis in urban neighborhoods. Results indicated some statistically significant  relationships, for instance, larger garden sizes per capita correlated positively with neighborhood resilience and social cohesion and negatively with stress. Spatial visualization showed that these associations were often spatially uneven. Additionally, low well-being neighborhoods that host low-quality community gardens were identified. Benchmarks and past literature were used to give suggestions on how to improve these gardens' qualities, to potentially improve the neighborhoods' well-being. 
While causal relationships could not be established from this research, the study provides a replicable framework for integrating spatial and statistical methods to inform equitable community garden placement and design.

the probability that a loan will default. The connection between loans is
mapped by converting a dataset to a graph and then inserting that graph into
the GCN. The GCN is used to predict the probability that a loan will default.
The used GCN is compared to two benchmark algorithms, namely a logistic
regression model and a random forest model. The results of this paper show
that the GCN performs better than the two benchmark algorithms, indicating
that a graph structure offers a positive impact in predicting loan defaults.",Bachelor Business Information Technology (B-BIT),"Wasser, D.M.",July 2025,English,"No

107415,Efficient Network On Chip for a RISC-V based neuromorphic processor,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107415,"Neuromorphic processors utilize distributed nodes for parallel and energy-efficient computations that are well-suited for neural network workloads. These nodes require a communication mechanism that is both low-overhead and simple, without compromising system performance.
This thesis presents the design and evaluation of a power- and area-efficient Network on Chip (NoC) for neuromorphic processors. This NoC is designed for optimizing Power, Performance, Area (PPA) trade-offs while managing congestion and data transfer. To achieve these goals, the architecture employs a 2D mesh topology with input First In, First Out (FIFO) buffers, round-robin (RR) scheduling, a ready/valid handshaking protocol, store-and-forward packet switching, and dynamic XY routing. A First In, First Out (FIFO) depth of four and dynamic XY routing were selected to optimize performance under congestion. Experimental results show that the system achieves a throughput of one packet per clock cycle under non-congested conditions, with a measured propagation delay of four clock cycles. Power analysis reveals that the energy per packet is 296 fJ, and the idle power consumption of one node is 22μW . Optimal performance is achieved with a directional data flow, such as that of a neural network, which is due to the potential for cyclic dependencies introduced by the interaction of routing and flow control. The NoC interconnects NEORV32 processors optimized for event-driven Artificial Neural Network (ANN) computations. In this experiment, a standardized 4-by-4 NoC is deployed with different mapping strategies of the same ANN. Results show that the NoC contributes only 0.24% to the total area and between 2.9% and 5.2% to overall energy consumption. As the system becomes more parallel, a trade-off emerges between active communication overhead and performance gains.",Master Embedded Systems (M-EMSYS),"Moolenaar, Sharon",July 2025,English,"No.

affective states through physical motion remains largely under-explored. Al-
though research has examined embodiment, emotional presence, and social
connectedness in telepresence applications, little attention has been paid
to how simple wheeled robots can express affective states purely through
movement. Hence, this thesis investigates how human observers perceive

Verbal Deception Detection Within the Investigative Interview : Testing the Differences in Provided Verbal Cues Between Autistic and Neurotypical Suspects,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107412,"In the investigative interview, one main goal is gathering reliable details. However, suspects might try to mislead the interviewer. Therefore, detecting deception is important in investigative interviewing. Reality monitoring (RM) can be used for this, focusing on differences in the number of details to discriminate deception. The number of details mentioned can be influenced by cognitive load. Due to difficulties in cognitive load, autistic individuals might have difficulties with providing lies or provide fewer details due to encoding difficulties which could reduce the effectiveness of RM, since the testimony of an autistic individual might be incorrectly classified as a lie due to the vulnerability. This paper is among the first to research the use of RM with autistic suspects. We used a 2 (autistic vs. neurotypical) x 2 (guilty vs. innocent) quasi-experimental design interviewing students in a mock-investigative interview. The results showed that autism did not influence the number of details provided and that cognitive load had no effect on the relationship between autism and the number of provided details.

Digitale mentale gezondheidsinterventies (DMHi's) kunnen een laagdrempelige manier bieden om de ondersteuning voor deze doelgroep te verbreden. De effectiviteit van DMHi's hangt echter sterk af van de mate van engagement van studenten, maar deze is vaak onvoldoende. Veel interventies maken gebruik van een 'one-size-fits-all' benadering, waardoor individuele behoeften worden beperkt. Personalisatie kan hiervoor een oplossing bieden. In dit onderzoek is onderzocht of personalisatie op basis van klachten of op basis van voorkeur leidt tot meer engagement bij studenten. Hiervoor zijn 34 studenten gerandomiseerd in een klachtengroep en een voorkeursgroep, waarbij ze twee weken lang een DMHi gebruikten.

A critical challenge in any physical design flow is optimization of Performance, Power, and Area (PPA). This challenge is further complicated by the “predictive gap”--the discrepancy between post-synthesis estimates and final post-layout PPA results. This thesis investigates the significance of this gap in an open-source toolchain and compares synthesis quality when implementing an identical RISC-V System on a chip using the open-source Yosys and the proprietary Cadence Genus synthesis tools. Both flows targeted the IHP 130~nm PDK. Post-synthesis analysis revealed that the proprietary tool produced a more efficient netlist, at the cost of a longer runtime. Critically, post-synthesis timing proved to be an unreliable predictor of final performance in the open-source flow; a design that met timing after synthesis exhibited significant timing violations after physical implementation. This was accompanied by an increase in power and area due to buffer insertion for the clock tree and hold-time fixing. The results highlight the trade-offs between the rapid iteration speed of current open-source tools and the refined optimization of mature, proprietary ones, while underscoring that the predictive gap remains a significant challenge.",Bachelor Electrical Engineering (B-EE),"Visser, B.T.",July 2025,English,"No.

Existing heuristic approaches, such as HEFT and MinMin, typically rely on basic task properties and may fail to capture deeper structural dependencies in the task graph. In this work, we propose a novel list-scheduling heuristic based on Longest Betweenness Centrality (LBC), a metric designed to quantify a task's influence by evaluating its presence on long dependency paths. We introduce six LBC-based ranking methods, including variants that are source-based and successor-weighted. The most promising variant, LBC-SRL, estimates task criticality by analyzing each task's current critical dependencies.
Experimental evaluations across five synthetic DAG generation models and multiple processor configurations demonstrated that LBC-SRL consistently outperforms classical heuristics such as MinMin, HCPT and PEFT. On DAGs with a high density, LBC-SRL achieves performance comparable to HEFT. Although HEFT remains the top performer overall, pairwise comparisons reveal that LBC-SRL frequently matches its performance and occasionally even surpasses it.

master’s theses from a technical department at a Dutch university, written
in english, spanning from 2018–2025.
All theses from the department were analyzed, with three programs
highlighted— including two technical programs (theses are completed in
half a semester) and a creative technology program (theses are completed
in one semester)—as these had the most published theses between 2018

periods were contrasted using two lexical diversity metrics (vocd-D, MTLD)
and three syntactic complexity metrics (mean sentence length, clauses per
sentence, sentence length variation).
Results show a significant rise in lexical diversity after 2022: vocd-D in-
creases by 8.3 % and MTLD by 13.6 %, suggesting broader vocabulary use
with AI support. In contrast, syntactic complexity remains stable within
narrow bounds across all programs (clauses per sentence: 0.75–0.78; mean

Applying these insights, a practical SNA case study of the Twente Hub project reveals a centralized network structure where a single industrial stakeholder plays a central role, acting as a communication broker that links to various groups of research, community, and regulatory actors. Centralization, despite being efficient, creates a likely network vulnerability, such as information bottlenecks, which would compromise resilience.

107387,Effects of metal gate-induced compressive strain on hole mobility in Si at cryogenic temperatures,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107387,"Silicon acceptor spin qubits are one of the most
promising avenues to the realisation of a multi-qubit quantum
computer. At the same time, design is quite complex due to
the necessary lifting of the Si valence band degeneracy. As the
qubit must be cooled down to cryogenic temperatures to operate,
one possible approach is to use the difference in coefficients
of thermal expansion of silicon and the metal gates to induce
compressive strain in the Si substrate. This work investigates the
relationship between hole mobility and channel strain induced by
the contraction of a metal gate cooled down to 2 K, as well as the
impact of device annealing time on this relationship. It is shown
that in devices annealed in H2O vapour for 5 min, increasing
the gate thickness from 20 nm to 60 nm results in higher hole
mobility. This indicates a higher induced compressive strain. The
mobility enhancement is larger along the ⟨1 1 0⟩ crystal orientation
compared to the ⟨1 0 0⟩ crystal orientation, reinforcing previously
documented directional dependence of holes in Si. A preferential
mobility enhancement along the ⟨1 1 0⟩ crystal orientation is also
observed in devices annealed in H2O vapour for 10 min, however
to a much lesser extent, and with no equivalent enhancement
along the ⟨1 0 0⟩ crystal orientation. This suggests that extended
annealing reduces or counteracts the gate-induced strain, and that
it is at least suffcient to nullify mobility enhancement along the
inferior ⟨1 0 0⟩ crystal orientation.",Bachelor Electrical Engineering (B-EE),"Wesolowski, Lukasz",July 2025,English,"No

107384,Safe Rounding for Optimistic Value Iteration in Probabilistic Model Checking,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107384,"Probabilistic model checking (PMC) computes quantitative properties on probabilistic models. These properties include probabilities of reaching failure states and expected rewards on models like Markov chains and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Numerical correctness matters for safety-critical applications. Existing model checkers use floating-point arithmetic for performance, which introduces rounding errors that accumulate and compromise results. Safe rounding techniques solve this problem by controlling the rounding direction: lower bounds round down and upper bounds round up. This guarantees that the computed interval contains the true value. Optimistic value iteration (OVI) computes epsilon-correct probability and reward bounds through a two-phase approach. It first obtains a lower bound through standard value iteration (VI), then derives an upper bound. Hartmanns demonstrated safe rounding for interval iteration (II), but, to our knowledge, no safe implementation of OVI existed. This paper presents the first safe rounding implementation of OVI in the Modest Toolset's mcsta. We identify the critical rounding points in OVI's two-phase structure and implement directed rounding using C99's floating-point environment. Our implementation supports three FPU (Floating Point Unit) modes: default, SSE, and x87.

append-only logs known as Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. Certificate
transparency helps identify fraud and misissuance by ensuring that each
issued certificate is logged in at least one CT log, with a timestamp, to facili-
tate independent auditing and monitoring. The issue arises when additional
information is inadvertently included in these certificates. For example, a
personal email might be added to a standard TLS (Transport Layer Security)
certificate that is not intended for email encryption. Due to the immutability
of CT logs, this data becomes a permanent source of information that can
be mined and used against organizations and individuals. Previous research
done in 2019 has shown that private information, such as emails and names,
has leaked into CT logs in the past, but it is not clear whether the issue
still occurs in certificates issued today. In this paper, we characterize the
occurrence of private information found in X.509 certificates, focusing on
the subject and subject alternate name fields. We leverage big data analytics

This paper presents a broadly applicable, modular framework that leverages process mining, statistical analysis, machine learning, and a novel activity role classification to assess and improve fairness, efficiency, and transparency in judicial decision-making. Applied to 247 German social court cases, the framework identified four process clusters: (1) fast-track cases resolved through early settlements or withdrawals; (2) complex, trial-driven cases with extended durations; (3) expert-heavy cases with frequent coordination bottlenecks; and (4) moderate-complexity resolutions. A multi-level fairness analysis (statistical, predictive, and causal) found only minor differences between court chambers, with no substantial effect on case duration. Activity role classification revealed that individual orders amplify procedural complexity, while repeated medical assessments are major bottlenecks. Transparency analysis showed that unpredictability and process opacity are concentrated in administrative and assessment-related transitions, pinpointing where targeted improvements could enhance clarity and predictability.

Building upon prior work that demonstrated a hybrid Rust compiler capable of targeting both CPU and GPU from a single source, we address a key limitation: the inability to use many standard Rust features within GPU kernel code. This limitation arises because compiler 'language items' ('lang-items'), which implement core features, often rely on CPU-specific assumptions that are invalid in the GPU context. To overcome this, we extend the existing hybrid compiler with a context-dependent lang-item system. This system enables the compiler to select specialized, GPU-safe implementations for lang-items when compiling kernel code, while retaining standard implementations for host code. As a result, a significantly broader range of idiomatic Rust features becomes available within GPU kernels, substantially improving the practicality and expressiveness of integrated hybrid compilation in Rust.",Bachelor Technical Computer Science (B-TCS),"Begu, Cristian-Andrei",July 2025,English,"No.

107360,AI for Automatic Feedback on Assessment Portfolios in Secondary Education,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107360,"The purpose of this paper is to support a program designed to assist Dutch secondary education teachers in assessing student assignments. The teachers' work is graded by instructors based on a set of criteria, with a pass/fail rating and an optional comment. A locally-run LLM is used to generate feedback instead of the instructors. Running LLMs locally requires smaller models, which perform worse in Dutch. To find out the quality of using these smaller LLMs to generate feedback, we first analyzed the language performance in Dutch with various benchmarks for Gemma-3-27B-it. Furthermore, several approaches were explored to generate feedback with the model, including incorporating summaries of textbook chapters and an answer model. Feedback quality was manually assessed by an instructor, and automatically via pass/fail agreement with the reference feedback and using the LLM-as-judge framework, G-Eval, with Qwen3-32B.
After analyzing the performance of Gemma-3-27B-it, we found that the model shows strong comprehension, but still struggles with understanding specific semantics of a sentence. Moreover, we found that supplying extra context of the textbook and the corresponding answer model in the prompt improves the quality of the feedback, according to one of the involved instructors. The scores from G-Eval with Qwen also returned the same conclusion.
For future work, the system should have an appropriate interface for which the generated feedback can be further evaluated in practice.
Our contributions with this paper are (1) showing how the Dutch language performance of LLMs can be analyzed, (2) how extra context can be used to improve the output of generated feedback, and that (3) smaller LLMs can be used to evaluate content using LLM-as-judge.",Bachelor Technical Computer Science (B-TCS),"Nieuwenhuis, Kevin",July 2025,English,"No.

107359,Combining Vision language models and gaze tracking in VR art exhibitions,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107359,"In recent years, virtual reality and the integration of conversational agents have become more prevalent in art exhibitions, which has led to the exploration of new methods to enhance user experience. Although eye tracking and conversational agents have been utilised separately until now, their combined application remains under-explored. This study investigates how integrating real-time gaze data with a vision language model (VLM) supports the automatic identification of areas of interest (AOIs) and influences user experience in a VR art gallery. To evaluate AOI identification, we first assessed the baseline of the VLM by manually checking the capacity of the VLM with and without contextual information. Afterwards, we introduced the contextual information and compared the answers between the manually defined AOI agent and the gaze-driven agent. To assess the user experience, a user study with 27 participants assessed enjoyment, engagement, personalisation, collaboration, and gaze awareness through a VR visit, a questionnaire and an interview. The results suggest that the VLM, when provided with gaze data on a image and a basic text prompt, can identify AOIs in most cases with a quantitative success rate of 72% of AOIs correctly identified in 53 coordinates. The system can detect AOIs beyond those predefined in the contextual information, generating more focused and relevant responses.
Although no statistically significant differences in user experience were observed between gaze-informed and manually guided agents, the findings suggest that a gaze-based approach could support similarly effective user interactions while reducing the manual effort required to define AOIs.

Self-management is applied to reduce this burden by making patients active participants in managing their disease. However, current self-management advice given by healthcare professionals lacks the patient perspective, focusing on the clinical view. This thesis explores the development of an educational tool for the patient perspective of COPD self-management targeting healthcare professionals. A story map prototype was developed in which users get to experience a patient story following the phases of COPD progression. Decision points are used in which the user gets to interact with the narrative, changing how the patient receives care to gain insights into the consequences of their actions. User evaluations were conducted to assess the tool. The evaluation results showed that the tool is perceived positively for its accessibility, interactivity and realism. The tool was evaluated with an average score of 4.3 out of 5 from SUPR-Q. The tool should be implemented in educational settings, since it has potential to increase the patient perspective awareness of healthcare professionals.

system and whether a model achieves its desired properties. This approach is
often fully automated and is applied, among other areas, within the context
of timed automata. Timed automata are a formalism that captures properties
related to quantitative time, facilitating the modelling of real-time systems
where time is a significant aspect. Probabilistic timed automata are an extension
of classical timed automata, with the capacity to model the uncertainty
of events along with timing constraints. The digital clock method in probabilistic
timed automata abstracts real-valued clock variables into integer
representations, resulting in a finite-state model that preserves the timing
properties required in formal verification. This abstraction is typically sound
for diagonal-free clocks, where the constraints of a clock can be only in
relation to a constant, not to another clock. We analyse the behaviour of a
digital clock abstraction algorithm developed in the Modest Toolset when
presented with diagonal constraints and modify it to accommodate them.

While prior research has been conducted on how ESG ratings impact stock returns and profitability and how ESG ratings mitigate firm-specific crash risk, there is a lack of studies exploring how ESG impacts the business value of companies. Thus, this thesis aims to explore whether ESG related data, such as the specific pillars: environmental, social, governance, and controversies can improve the time series forecasts of business value in the oil and gas sector using forecasting models as Prophet, XGBoost, and LSTM. The results indicate that, in the majority of experiments, incorporating independent features from the individual ESG pillars into the Prophet model yields more accurate forecasts compared to the same time series model based solely on business value. Similar results are obtained for different models tested. These findings give academics and professionals a new methodological toolkit for improving business value forecasts by leveraging ESG pillar data.

Experiments analyzing various mutation and crossover strategies confirmed that the GCP structure is effective at producing interpretable agent logic. The results demonstrate that the GA successfully evolved agents capable of basic survival tactics, primarily by learning to avoid self-destructive behaviors. However, the key finding of this research is that agent performance was fundamentally constrained by the fitness function, which failed to adequately reward complex strategic and tactical maneuvers. This work concludes that while GAs combined with GCPs provide a viable framework for generating understandable AI, achieving high-level strategic competence is critically dependent on the design of a more sophisticated fitness function that can guide evolution beyond simple behaviors.",Bachelor Technical Computer Science (B-TCS),"Wijma, Tim",July 2025,Dutch,"No.

107350,Anonymization of Images for Privacy Protection on Embedded Systems,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107350,"As small, camera-equipped devices become increasingly common, they of-
ten capture images containing faces and other personal details. This raises
significant privacy concerns, especially under regulations such as the Euro-
pean Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which require
that such sensitive data be anonymized. However, implementing strong pri-
vacy safeguards directly on these devices is challenging due to their limited
computing power.
In our research, we explore the trade-off between computational efficiency
and privacy protection by implementing three lightweight anonymization
techniques, namely masking, pixelation, and blurring, directly on a resource-
constrained embedded platform, the ESP32-P4. Each method is evaluated
for its execution time and its effectiveness at protecting identity, the lat-
ter measured using cosine similarity scores derived from the DeepFace
Python library. By analyzing the performance and privacy impact of these
techniques, our work aims to uncover practical strategies for real-time, on-
device anonymization. This enables privacy-preserving image capture at the
edge, without the need for potentially insecure cloud processing.
Our findings show that all three anonymization techniques can be exe-
cuted in under 2 microseconds on the ESP32-P4, making them highly suitable
for real-time processing. The full anonymization pipeline, including face
˜
detection, operates at
20 milliseconds per frame, enabling throughput up
to 50 FPS. While detection accuracy reached 59.2% across a diverse dataset

107349,Grading Student Solutions for Automata,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107349,"Even though multiple solutions exist for grading automata, these solutions have some limitations which can negatively impact the grade of students. This is because most algorithms either check whether a solution given by a student is entirely correct, or entirely incorrect. There are already existing solutions for grading automata with partial grades, however these are extremely limited in which actions can be executed on an automaton. The goal of this study is to determine correction rules that are fairer to the student and does not punish a student for continuing with the same mistake. Together with creating a new algorithm to grade the student solutions, which provides transparency about how the algorithm determined the grade. This would allow teachers to start using automated grading of automata, significantly decreasing the workload. In this paper 11 corrections are proposed, which can be used to transform an automaton until it is a correct solution. For these rules, fairness towards the student was kept in mind. Together with these corrections a specification for an algorithm to apply these corrections and use that to grade solutions has been given. Unfortunately, it became apparent that the given algorithm in its current form is not very performant and not feasible to be used on a lot of solutions, this results from the substantial number of branches that the algorithm has to traverse. However, with more research it can be expected to achieve a better performance.

An energy management algorithm ‘Profile Steering’ aims to peak-shave consumer loads by adjusting devices within a neighborhood towards a flat aggregate profile. This algorithm focuses on the biggest improvers. To incentivize people to participate in such programs, the notion of fairness needs to be incorporated. Based on known motivations and barriers, the equality principle is followed. This aims for an equal amount of inconvenience for all participants. An intuitive metric to measure equality is used, the Gini Coefficient. Using these principles, an adaption ‘Fairer Profile Steering’ is proposed that considers the burden of a participant, based on the deviation from the default operation. A tunable focus variable τ determines the focus between flexibility and fairness. Simulation results show that the notion of fairness can be incorporated in such an algorithm without compromising peak-shaving performance. The adaption can reduce inequality of burdens by 41% compared to regular Profile Steering, but comes as a trade-off for computation speed.

and its potential influence on the formation of content filter bubbles is
investigated. YouTube Kids videos are collected by a Playwright pipeline,
which are then included in a recommendation tree. The results show that
the entropy remains stable along the average recommendation sequence,
going against the claim of the algorithm pushing users into filter bubbles.
Transition matrices do showcase potential biases in the algorithm towards
recommending certain content, particularly videos in the ’Cartoons’ category.
The matrices also show high self-transition probabilities, indicating a high
likelihood for the algorithm to recommend the same genre of video multiple
times in a row. These findings suggest moderate content diversity on the

A Finite State Automaton (FSA) was developed to automate interactions with the NLP bot, generating responses that follow predefined strategies based on the sentiment scores of previous replies. These sentiment scores, ranging from -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive), were obtained using sentiment analysis tools. Statistical analysis, including t-tests and Pearson correlation, revealed that ChatGPT’s responses are significantly influenced by the emotional intensity of prior messages. While it generally maintains a positive tone, the bot demonstrates a measurable tendency to mirror the sentiment strength of user inputs, suggesting a limited but non-negligible capacity for emotional nuance in conversational contexts.",Bachelor Technical Computer Science (B-TCS),"Navarro Martí, Fèlix",July 2025,English,"No

This study investigates the estimation of three-dimensional knee joint kinetics from inertial measurement unit (IMU) data using a physics-informed neural network (PINN) during walking and single-leg hop tests. A data processing pipeline was developed to align and generalize inertial and optical motion capture data. Segment kinematics derived from IMUs were used as input to estimate knee joint kinetics, while enabling three-dimensional inverse dynamics through rigid-body modeling. An adaptable neural network framework was designed to incorporate physical constraints via a loss function based on three-dimensional segment-based inverse dynamics. The PINN was compared to a baseline data-driven model to evaluate prediction performance. While the physical constraints supported biomechanical interpretable estimations, the PINN did not outperform the baseline model. Both models showed reduced accuracy for kinetic components with lower magnitudes, particularly in the mediolateral direction. Moreover, no consistent improvements were found under limited data conditions or varied physical loss weighting. These findings suggest that physical constraints may not enhance performance when data quantity or consistency is insufficient. Despite these limitations, this study provides a methodological basis for future research on IMU-based kinetic estimation in ACLR rehabilitation. Further development is needed to improve model accuracy and robustness.

This thesis explores how behavior change theory can inform meal recommender design in shared living contexts. Four personas were developed based on a literature review of FW drivers and validated through six semi-structured interviews. These informed a two-part evaluation: (1) assessing student perceptions of a persona-driven MRS concept grounded in the COM-B model and behavior change techniques (BCTs), and (2) evaluating feature ideas tailored to one persona—the “Confused Beginner.” A survey with 139 students, supported by visual design mockups, revealed three main insights: users preferred personalization outcomes but resisted rigid persona assignments; practical, low-effort features (e.g., inventory reminders) were favored over gamified or abstract ones; and social features were effective only when framed as collaborative.

107316,Human-Centered HMI Design for Industry 4.0,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107316,"Industry 4.0 is changing the manufacturing industry. Today, machines must be highly versatile
 and easily connected. To enable this and maintain the software of these machines, a modular
 implementation is essential. With the change in machine implementation, new challenges
 arise for the build of the connected Human-Machine Interface (HMI). The HMI must be as
 modular, adaptable, and open as the underlying implementation while remaining user-friendly.
 In the manufacturing context, different user groups, like operators, service technicians and
 application developers, interact with the HMIs. Hence, the problem addressed in this thesis is
 how to design an HMI in the manufacturing industry that is usable by different user groups
 while respecting the modularity, versatility, and maintainability of the implementation of the
 control software. To investigate this research question, a human-centered design process was
 applied to the development of new control software at Herrmann Ultrasonics. Herrmann
 Ultrasonics produces ultrasonic welding machines that can be controlled through an HMI,
 making it a possible use case. Initial user research, including interviews, observations, and a
 card sort, revealed multiple user needs and themes that then guided the prototype design. A
 f
 irst user test with a paper prototype that stayed close to the modular implementation showed
 that users were easily overwhelmed by too many modular building blocks without guidance. A
 second digital prototype that introduced guidance on the cost of an additional logic layer of
 the implementation shows improvement for the user. From the insights gathered, this thesis

which translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. At the top
of this hierarchical system, there are the root servers, which handle billions of
queries per day and serve as the starting point for DNS resolution processes.
To reduce dependence on these root servers and improve performance and
resilience, RFC 8806 proposes the use of local copies of the root zone, known
as local root, on recursive resolvers.
Despite the potential benefits, it remains unclear to what extent this
feature has been adopted in practice. In this paper, we investigate the possible
deployment of locally served root zones. To evaluate the impact of this setup,
we first conducted local testing using DNS resolver software, namely BIND
and Unbound. We observed a significant decrease in root query response
times; when using Unbound, the average dropped from 130 milliseconds per
query to as low as 1.5 ms, when a local root zone was in use. These results
show the benefits of local root configurations under controlled conditions.
We then analyzed data from 1,000 RIPE Atlas probes and identified around
40 probes that rely on resolvers with DNS resolution patterns that suggest
they may be configured with local root. These probes showed response times
that were likely too fast to involve querying the root servers. However, due
to factors like aggressive caching or infrastructure configurations, we cannot
confirm with certainty that these probes were using a local root zone.

deployments in controlled environments and the difficulty of identifying

The survey measured three independent variables, namely SDT needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness), views Skills & Competencies, and expected AI-driven changes to the seven CanMEDS facets against one dependent variable, willingness to adopt AI, via multiple linear regression. Qualitatively, 5 themes with 12 sub themes emerged with specialists welcoming AI that speeds work but resisting tools that obscure or supplant core knowledge. Quantitatively, stronger views on skills and competences predicted greater willingness to adopt AI (β≈.05, p=.002). Competence added a small positive effect (β≈.18, p=.013), while autonomy and relatedness were non-significant. Expecting AI to change many CanMEDS facets did not predict willingness to adopt AI, although anticipating alterations to the Knowledge/Science facet specifically decreased it (β≈–.62, p=.009).  Adoption depends less on generic tech optimism than on “Capability Assurance,”  the requirement  that AI will support rather than erode specialist’s ability to practise safely and capably.

In this project, this challenge is tackled through image segmentation using a Deep Learning approach. The study aims to develop a model capable of consistent and accurate segmentation of the catheter, with a secondary goal being gaining insight in what model and training characteristics are most beneficial for this task. More than 30 models with varying architectures and hyperparameters were developed for analysis. The primary hyperparameters explored included the optimizer, loss function, and learning rate. In addition, the study examined the employment of data augmentations. Finally, the performance of two key architectures were compared: the Base ResUNet and Attention ResUNet.

107301,Validating Agent-Based Models with Probabilistic Model Checkers,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107301,"This study explores the use of probabilistic model checking (PMC) to verify agent-based models (ABMs) from the social sciences. It focuses on a rumour-spreading model proposed by Mazzoli et al. (2018). The ABM has been encoded as a discrete-time Markov chain in the PRISM model checker. A set of 14 properties has been defined in order to formally verify the model. The results show consistency with the original paper’s simulation results, confirming that formal verification can capture core dynamics, such as spontaneous activation of spreaders or debunking effects. However, challenges like state-space explosion or limited scalability demonstrate the trade-offs of this approach. This study shows that formal tools like PRISM are able to reproduce and even deepen the analysis of ABMs, offering formal guarantees and better insights into system behaviour. However, limitations were also observed, such as large memory usage and scalability issues. This positions PMC as a complementary method to simulation, valuable for medium-scale social networks with rule-driven or well-defined agent behaviours.",Bachelor Technical Computer Science (B-TCS),"Balotescu, Alexia",July 2025,English,"No

107300,The role of gamification in shaping customer retention : A generational perspective,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107300,"Gamification has emerged as a popular strategy to boost customer retention, but does it work 
equally well for everyone? This thesis explores how gamified systems influence user loyalty 
and how age-related differences shape their effectiveness. Using a mixed-methods design, 
including a gamified experimental survey, quantitative analysis, and qualitative thematic 
insights, this study offers a comprehensive look into the mechanics of user engagement.
Findings show that gamification can strengthen customer retention, but its success depends 
heavily on the design of the system and the demographic it targets. While younger users were 
drawn to playful, symbolic features like streaks and badges, older users responded more 
positively to structured, benefit-driven elements such as point systems and discounts. These 
generational patterns reveal distinct motivational profiles, challenging the notion of a one-size-fits-all approach.
Ultimately, gamification is most effective when it aligns with users' psychological needs and 
expectations. This thesis contributes to academic literature and design practice alike by showing 
that meaningful, age-sensitive gamification can foster long-term user engagement and loyalty.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Brinkmann, Theresa",July 2025,English,"No.

The focus is on assisting employees of a Power Platform consulting firm in creating more usable and accessible solutions with Microsoft Power Platform tools, specifically Power BI and Power Apps.
A user-centered design (UCD) approach guided the research, which was structured around three objectives: identifying the need for internal best practices, designing practical guidelines, and evaluating their effectiveness. The study began with a theoretical and technical review of usability, accessibility, and the Power Platform. This was followed by an analysis of the current state of usability and accessibility features within Power BI and Power Apps.
To identify internal needs, seven semi-structured interviews were conducted with employees of the company. The findings revealed a lack of formal standards and limited awareness of accessibility practices, with a shared motivation to improve. Based on these insights, a set of internal guidelines was developed and published on the company’s SharePoint intranet. These guidelines were designed to be practical, easy to navigate, and directly relevant to employees’ workflows.
Two focus groups, one for Power BI and one for Power Apps users, were held to evaluate the guidelines. Participants confirmed the value of the resource and suggested improvements such as simplified language, visual examples, and quick-reference checklists.
The results demonstrate that user-centered methods are effective for designing and evaluating internal guidelines that support inclusive and consistent development practices. The guidelines created through this research serve as a foundation for integrating usability and accessibility into daily workflows at the company.

107295,Enhancing the versatility of dynamic prosthetic feet in the context of the nova foot by Gyromotics,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107295,"Despite a global need for prosthetic care, only 5–10% lower-limb amputees currently have access, emphasizing the urgent demand for affordable, high-performance solutions. In response to this need, Gyromotics introduced Nova, a modular, cost-effective prosthetic foot. While it offers adaptability and ease of maintenance, it lacks an adjustable ankle joint, limiting comfort, terrain adaptability, and footwear compatibility. This thesis addresses that limitation by redesigning Gyromotics' ankle to improve performance, usability, and reduce weight. Two design concepts were developed and evaluated using FEM analysis. The results were measured against project-specific design criteria and the ISO standard 22675. The final concept—a manually adjustable ankle joint—achieves a sagittal range of motion of 145° in dorsiflexion and 76° in plantarflexion, enhancing adaptability, comfort, and therefore, performance. Usability testing revealed increased usability compared to Gyromotics' previous ankle joint model, although further testing is necessary to confirm performance under dynamic loading conditions. The design process revealed key mechanical and ergonomic factors that formed a modular design framework for broader integration across Gyromotics' and other prosthetic companies' product portfolios.

Our objective is to uncover hidden attack vectors represented as nodes that were not yet in the tree and improve the completeness of the attack tree in terms of the number of nodes (tree depth), using the 2017 Equifax data breach as the main focus. This was done by simulating the Equifax environment on a virtual machine in which a vulnerable version of Apache Struts was running. The attack was then recreated by following the steps of a crime script, and any missing steps were analyzed, along with alternative paths that the attacker could have taken.

This study develops a framework for predicting four key micronutrients, calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se), in Malawian maize grain by combining one-time ground observations with 61 terrain, climate, soil, remote-sensing variables, and Global Agro-Ecological Zones. An XGBoost algorithm was trained for each micronutrient using spatial cross-validation approach to address the potential spatial autocorrelation bias. Model skill varied: test R² reached 0.15 for Ca, 0.14 for Zn, 0.08 for Fe and was negligible for Se; RMSEs were 18.9 mg kg⁻¹ (Ca), 25.1 mg kg⁻¹ (Fe), 3.7 mg kg⁻¹ (Zn) and 0.03 mg kg⁻¹ (Se). Elevation, precipitation, top-soil pH and organic carbon strongly influenced Ca, Fe and Zn predictions, while radar-derived canopy metrics dominated Se. The spatial distribution of the maize nutrient revealed a south-to-north decrease in micronutrient levels, aligning with the known gradients in soil pH, organic matter and climate.

107275,Distillation and Partial Model Freezing for Continual Learning in Neural Fields,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107275,"Neural fields have increasingly been utilised as signal representations. Using neural networks, they can be applied as solutions to problems such as creating continuous representations and solving inverse problems. In some use cases, the signals represented are not only spatial but also temporal. In practice, when such a signal has to be represented, it can be beneficial to incorporate measurements into an existing neural field as soon as they are available. However, this presents a problem, as neural networks, which neural fields are based on, can forget knowledge learnt when being presented with new knowledge.
In this work, we investigate how continual learning affects neural fields of different architectures. Additionally, we demonstrate two methods that can be used to remedy the problems caused by continual learning in neural fields. First, we demonstrate how the model trained on earlier tasks can be reused to prevent performance degradation through knowledge distillation when learning a subsequent task. Second, we demonstrate how, for models using a DINER architecture, a part of the model can be frozen, thereby lowering performance loss while still allowing the model to learn to represent new measurements.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Visser, W.A.",July 2025,English,"No

107273,Beyond 200 Hz : An Evaluation of Low-Rate IMU Sampling for Pedestrian Inertial Odometry,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107273,"Mobile and wearable devices with limited energy resources increasingly rely on inertial measurement unit (IMUs) for pedestrian localisation. This is necessary in situations where the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) or Wi-Fi signals are not available. Although state-of-the-art neural inertial odometry models such as RoNIN achieve meter-level accuracy at high sampling rates such as 200 Hz9, operating at these rates significantly drain battery life and computational resources. This paper investigates the minimum viable IMU sampling rate capable of maintaining acceptable pedestrian inertial odometry accuracy. To maintain comparable localisation accuracy at lower sampling rates, two compensation strategies are investigated: (i) temporal upsampling of low-rate IMU data, and (ii) training neural odometry models directly with downsampled data. Extensive experiments conducted using the RoNIN dataset and custom-collected iOS pedestrian IMU data show a rapid increase in drift as sampling rate decreases. Temporal upsampling, even with sophisticated Kalman–RTS smoothing, fails to recover lost high-frequency information, resulting in severe localisation errors (>170 m). Direct retraining of RoNIN at reduced frequencies (10–150 Hz) significantly outperformed naive interpolation methods, yet accuracy remained below the 200 Hz baseline. Findings indicate that 40 Hz represents a practical lower bound for applications tolerant of moderate drift (~10 m after several minutes), while rates below 30 Hz lead to unacceptable error (≥14 m after several minutes).",Bachelor Business Information Technology (B-BIT),"Hrechko, Pavlo",July 2025,English,"No

This research investigates how well decentralized Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policies enable multiple drones to reach assigned goals without collisions when each drone perceives only local, sensor-like information. A custom Gymnasium environment was built to simulate 2-D shared airspace with adjustable traffic density and obstacles number. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) served as the baseline algorithm for training the policies which will be responsible for the drone’s movement towards the goal and collision avoidance. Trained policies were evaluated on (i) collision-free episode rate, (ii) goal-completion rate, (iii) training sample efficiency, (iv) average steps for episode completion.

While vibrotactile feedback systems have shown promise in improving gait, their impact on static postural balance remains unexplored. This pilot study investigated the feasibility and preliminary effects of the Suralis system, a commercially available solution providing gait-synchronized vibrotactile sensory feedback. Within this study, it served as a tool for both measuring postural balance and delivering plantar pressure feedback during four postural balance tasks to individuals with bilateral lower extremity amputation. To validate the Suralis system's measurement capabilities, we conducted analyses including pressure-force comparisons, pressure distribution heatmaps, and vibration motor activation analysis. A custom multiple linear regression (MLR) model was employed to estimate the centre of pressure (CoP) from Suralis sensor readings, validated against force plates (GRAIL system). The study design involved an ABAB introduction/withdrawal protocol across four standing tasks (eyes open, eyes closed, cognitive dual task, reach and target task) to assess the intervention's effect on centre of pressure speed (CoPs) and Margin of Stability (MoS). Our findings indicate that the Suralis system, in its current state, demonstrates limitations in delivering consistent vibrotactile feedback, with inconsistencies observed in vibration motor activation based on individual sensor thresholds. However, the system shows accurate measurement capabilities for postural balance. The MLR model estimates the CoP with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) below 10 mm.

due to their high potential to accelerate the integration of multi-OoC models on platforms.
The modularity offers flexibility in design adaptions, and integration of components from multiple

Popular collaboration tools assume that all users follow the same project structure, which does not reflect how people actually prefer to organize their work. This thesis introduces FlexiTeX, a system that allows each user to keep their own project structure while still collaborating on the same content. The system works by flattening a LaTeX project, parsing it into an abstract tree that captures the logical structure. It then applies transformation rules to rebuild the project structure based on a configuration file. The transformation is designed to be reversible, idempotent and preserve the ability to compile the document. A proof of concept shows how this approach can be used in a collaborative setup where each user works in a personal branch and changes are synced through a shared internal version. An evaluation on real-world projects shows that the system preserves content in most cases, although some limitations remain due to parser behavior.

107258,Pandemic Preparedness for Elective Care : Managing Spare Resources by Considering Staff Absence Dynamics,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107258,"The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the challenge of maintaining elective care during
periods of health crisis. While research has focused heavily on forecasting pandemic-related
demand, less attention has been given to how hospitals can continue providing elective care
when resources are limited and staff availability is uncertain. This thesis addresses that
gap by analyzing the interplay between healthcare capacity, waitlist dynamics, and the
postponement of elective procedures in a pandemic context.
We focus on spare nursing capacity in general wards and develop a forecasting model
that accounts for both pandemic patient load and staff absence. Staff availability is modeled
as a Markov chain, assuming independent infection and recovery behavior. Elective care
waitlists are represented through a discrete queueing model to derive backlog distributions
under varying levels of resource fluctuation. This provides a clearer understanding of how
capacity constraints translate into delays in elective care.
We compare multiple elective scheduling strategies using Monte Carlo simulations based
on both synthetic data and real data from the first COVID-19 wave. To cope with fluctuating staff availability, overbooking predicted capacity can improve resource utilization.
However, this comes at the cost of a higher cancellation risk, which can be mitigated by
shorter scheduling horizons.
Our insights offer decision-makers a basis for planning elective care in future pandemic
scenarios, aiming to mitigate long-term population health consequences. The forecasting
model is designed to be simple and practical. It requires only pandemic demand forecasts,
staff infection rates, and observed staff availability. Using these, hospitals can estimate
daily capacity for elective care and evaluate scheduling policies tailored to their specific
setting.

insect outbreaks and wildfires, which are often intensified by prolonged droughts linked to climate
change. In Central Europe, the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) is the primary cause
of damage, to temperate forest resulting in millions of tons of dead Norway spruce (Picea abies).
Traditional detection methods, such as field surveys and aerial photography, are inadequate for
large-scale monitoring of such damage and often fail to identify early infestations when intervention
is most effective. Satellite remote sensing offers a promising approach for early and large-scale
detection of vegetation stress. This study investigated the potential of DLR Earth Sensing Imaging
Spectrometer (DESIS) and Sentinel-2 data for assessing bark beetle infestation in Spruce stands in
Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP), Germany. The spectral variability of spruce canopies
infested by bark beetles during the green and red attack phases were assessed using Sentinel-2 and
DESIS image spectroscopy data and the spectral bands sensitive to early-stage bark beetle
infestation (green attack) (i.e., in June)- were identified. Next, the potential of these data for
mapping the bark beetle infestation was examined using two Random Forest classification models.
To analyze spectral reflectance variations across infestation phases, first the location of healthy and
infested canopies was identified using field data and then the reflectance values of these canopies
were extracted from Sentinel-2 and DESIS imagery and processed in MATLAB R2024b to generate
spectral profiles. The red edge position (REP) was calculated for all infestation phases using the
polynomial fitting method. A one-way ANOVA test was applied to all 230 DESIS and 10 Sentinel-
2 spectral bands to identify spectral regions/bands sensitive to green attack infestation.
Subsequently, two Random Forest models were developed for discriminating against healthy and
infested canopies (Model A, used significant bands and vegetation indices, and Model B, which
used only the ANOVA-significant bands). Two infestation maps were generated using these
models for DESIS and Sentinel-2 datasets.
The results showed that canopies affected by green and red attack exhibited increased reflectance
in the visible spectrum and decreased reflectance in the near-infrared region. The analysis
demonstrated that REP shifted toward shorter wavelengths as the infestation progressed, indicating
stress and chlorophyll degradation. The ANOVA test identified bands in red edge, and near
infrared region as significant for detecting bark beetles green attack in both datasets. The Random
Forest model results revealed that using reflectance data from significant bands and vegetation
indices could allow an enhanced discrimination of healthy and infested canopies during green attack
(733 pixels (47%) out of 1,568 pixels in DESIS data, and 1,476 pixels (41%) out of 3,572 pixels in
Sentinel-2 data). The findings demonstrate the value of satellite hyperspectral remote sensing data

and degree to which generative AI, specifically, ChatGPT, can assist expert entrepreneurs to make effectual decisions. 
A qualitative approach was applied, including semi-structured interviews and and the addition of two surveys for a 
mixed method approach. Even though the initial plan was aimed at novice entrepreneurs, the focus was shifted to 
expert entrepreneurs to gain deeper, more valid insights into effectual decision-making. The findings reveal that 
effectual logic was applied most frequently, particularly in the early and scaling phases, with generative AI playing a 
fascilitating role in opportunity recognition and resource-based improvisation. Depending on the context, 
entrepreneurs alternated between logics, with causal logic appearing more often in the maturity stage. This

Data were used from female breast cancer patients treated curatively at UZ Leuven (2000–2018). After applying exclusion criteria and multiple imputation, the dataset was prepared for compatibility with the INFLUENCE 3.0 model. Calibration was assessed using the Integrated Calibration Index (ICI), E50, E90, and calibration plots. Discrimination was evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for cumulative yearly events. Results:
The final cohort included 8,548 patients (7,549 non-neoadjuvantly treated; 999 neoadjuvantly treated). Calibration was generally acceptable (ICI and E50 < 0.01), though risks were often overestimated at lower predicted values.

107249,Investigating the effects of implicit self-compassion cognitive bias modification on psychological flexibility and the moderating effects of distress among university students,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107249,"Students face significant mental health challenges, emphasising the necessity of investigating strategies fostering psychological flexibility and self-compassion. Self-compassion has been largely studied as an explicit concept, while its implicitness remains underexplored. Considering the influence of implicit processes, this study examines implicit and explicit self-compassion, the effects of cognitive bias modification (CBM) on psychological flexibility, and the moderating effects of psychological distress, and the mediating effects of implicit self-compassion. Using convenience sampling, 42 students were recruited and allocated into experimental (n = 28) and control (n = 14) groups. This experimental and longitudinal study collected data via SoSci Survey, with analyses conducted in RStudio (version 2024.12.1-563). Unexpectedly, CBM did not significantly affect implicit self-compassion or psychological flexibility. However, a marginal trend suggested a potential intervention effect of the CBM. Explicit and implicit self-compassion did not correlate, and the reliability of the implicit self-compassion measurement was poor. The reliability of the self-report scales was good to excellent. Implicit self-compassion did not mediate CBM on psychological flexibility, and psychological distress showed a marginal trend towards moderating that relationship. The missing correlation between implicit and explicit self-compassion suggests a need for a robust measurement that can capture the metacognitive complexity of self-compassion.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Pruski, S. von",July 2025,English,"No.

107247,Dual-path sampled anti-alias filtering,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107247,"This paper presents a novel approach to anti-
aliasing filters, dual-path sampled filters. Conventionally anti-aliasing filters are implemented using a regular low-pass filter and buffer in front of the analog-to-digital converter’s (ADC) sample-
and-hold. In modern ADCs this analog frontend can require more power than the rest of the ADC. Instead the anti-alias filter might be implemented with dual-path sampling, the unfiltered signal is applied to the top plate of the sampling capacitor, while a high-pass filtered signal is applied to the bottom plate. In theory this cancels the signals of high frequency out over the sampling
capacitor, while leaving signals with low frequencies intact.
To investigate this two dual-path filters were analysed, a first order filter with a low-pass response, and a second order filter with a low-pass notch response. Both filters were compared against similar regular alternatives in terms of component usage, filter response, driving requirements, noise, and total harmonic
distortion. It was found that the first-order dual-path filter dissipates 4x more power than the single-path filter for an equal SNR, and is more expensive, but is otherwise equivalent. The second order filter requires 4x more power than a comparable biquad filter to get an equal SNR, but has a worse response and driving requirements. It is then concluded that dual-path filters do not provide a superior alternative to regular single-path filters, requiring more power to achieve an equal SNR.",Bachelor Electrical Engineering (B-EE),"Woertman, Thomas",July 2025,English,"No

107230,Urban Water Management in Vriezenveen-Zuid : Design and Analysis of Retention Solutions,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107230,"This bachelor thesis investigates urban water management strategies for Vriezenveen-Zuid,
a new residential area in the municipality of Twenterand. The area is challenged with
climate change, low elevation, high groundwater levels and soil types with limited infiltration capacity. In collaboration with Waterschap Vechtstromen and the municipality of
Twenterand, this study aims to design and evaluate a decentralized retention solution that
reduces water nuisance due to extreme rainfall.
A design-driven research approach was chosen, combining literature research, spatial analysis and hydrological simulation. The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS CN)
method was used to quantify the runoff potential, while the Tygron Geo-design Platform
was used to simulate rainfall, water flows and retention capacity within the case study
area. Three precipitation scenarios were investigated (111 mm, 131 mm and 200 mm in 48
hours), in accordance with current standards, future projections and stress test standards.
Based on spatial constraints, elevation data, soil permeability and municipal planning
documents, suitable retention zones were identified in the planned green-blue corridors of
Vriezenveen-Zuid. Two solutions were implemented in the design: shallow infiltration wadis
and deeper buffer wadis. The design offers a total retention capacity of approximately 2000
m³ and includes overflow and drainage mechanisms towards the Lateraalkanaal. The system was tested under different groundwater levels and saturation conditions to assess its
robustness.
Simulation results indicate that the proposed design is effective under current conditions
and performs reasonably well under future climate scenarios. However, during the stress
test, the system exceeds its capacity, resulting in flooding in the northern zones. Sensitivity analyses show that both groundwater depth and initial soil saturation significantly
influence the infiltration performance, confirming the importance of the subsurface for
long-term effectiveness.
The findings show that decentralized water retention solutions are spatially feasible and hydrologically effective in developments such as Vriezenveen-Zuid. However, their resilience
to climate extremes depends on adaptive planning and sufficient design flexibility. The
study recommends integrating retention solutions from the earliest stages of spatial planning, with room for future up-scaling if rainfall patterns increase.
This study contributes to the understanding of how climate-resilient infrastructure can
be practically implemented in semi-rural urban expansions. It provides both a reproducible modeling approach and concrete policy recommendations for municipalities and
water boards that want to improve urban water resilience in a changing climate.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Groot Rouwen, M.A.H.",June 2025,English,"No

In this context, health economic evaluation plays a vital role in guiding healthcare decision-making by identifying cost-effective treatment strategies and ensuring that limited healthcare resources are used efficiently. Traditional health economic models, such as Markov models, often simplify clinical pathways by using predefined abstract states, fixed cycle lengths, and memory-less assumptions limiting their ability to reflect real-world care dynamics. This study aims to leverage process mining techniques to understand the variability and complexity of patient pathways in skin cancer care and integrate these insights into health economic modeling. Method: A Process-Guided Markov Model (PGMM) was developed using real-world healthcare event logs from Dutch patients with stage III C melanoma, including those who experienced
disease progression. Clinical activities were treated as health states, and transition probabilities and state durations were empirically derived from the logs. The model was structured in two phases—before and after disease progression with distinct transition matrices and cost-utility logic. Cost and Quality-Adjusted-Life Year (QALY) calculations were based on time-weighted utilities and
differentiated between one-time and recurring costs. Result: The PGMM was able to reflect the heterogeneity and sequence-specific behavior of real care pathways. Validation against real-world data showed that the simulation could approximate the distribution of observed costs and QALYs, although differences existed due to individualized patterns and data sparsity.",Master Health Sciences (M-HS),"Mohammadkhani, Sara",July 2025,English,"No

107225,"Extending LADM for integrated land governance : localizing the model to capture customary tenure in Dome, Ghana",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107225,"In Ghana’s peri-urban areas such as Dome, land tenure systems are shaped by the coexistence of statutory and customary regimes, producing inconsistent land records, overlapping claims, and persistent tenure insecurity. Despite legal reforms and digitization efforts, most land remains undocumented or governed by informal norms, undermining trust in formal land governance. The Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) offers a standardized framework for documenting diverse tenure types, but its implementation in Ghana has remained limited and misaligned with customary realities. This study employs a design science research methodology to investigate how local tenure practices in Dome can inform the development of a localized LADM-based model. Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and stakeholder engagement with landholders, chiefs, and institutional actors. Thematic analysis revealed key features of Dome’s land tenure landscape, including oral transactions, inheritance-based claims, informal boundary markers, and overlapping land rights. Based on these insights, the study proposes an adapted conceptual model grounded in LADM that reflects both statutory requirements and customary practices. The model was validated through participatory evaluation with domain stakeholders, including Lands Commission officials, customary land secretariat staff, residents and legal practitioners. Using criteria such as representational accuracy, legal alignment, and implementation feasibility, stakeholders reviewed the model against real-world tenure scenarios. Their feedback led to iterative refinements, such as adding locally resonant terminology and accommodating oral documentation types, ensuring the model’s contextual fit and institutional applicability. This research contributes to the literature on integrated land governance by demonstrating how global data standards can be tailored to diverse tenure systems, enhancing tenure security and supporting inclusive urban development in Ghana and similar contexts.",Master Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (M-GEO-WO),"Tetteh, Henry Tetteh",June 2025,English,"No.

107222,Splitting up Dutch boezem systems to increase flood safety : A case study on the Friese Boezem,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107222,"Climate change is increasing the flood risk in The Netherlands, because of sea level
rise and heavier precipitation events. This is especially the case for the Dutch boezem
systems, which are large interconnected water systems that discharge the water from the
Dutch polders into a sea, lake or river. While these systems have a target water level,
maintaining this water level becomes more and more difficult when the amount of water they
need to discharge increases. One possible solution to keep Dutch boezem systems flood safe
is to split up a boezem into two separate systems. The idea behind this intervention is that
when a boezem is split, the water level in one of the new boezems can be lowered which
increases the water storage capacity. In this report it was researched whether splitting up
Dutch boezem systems increases flood safety, using the Friese Boezem as a case study.
In order to test whether a split of the Friese Boezem improved flood safety, five
alternatives for a split were simulated using a Python model. This model simulated splits of
the Friese Boezem in its current scenario without sea level rise or wind effects. The results of
these simulations were then compared to the results of the current situation of the Boezem
without a split. After that, a sensitivity analysis was performed by conducting fixed-value
tests in order to test how the models react to small changes of the parameters, and a
degenerate test was performed to test whether the model gives the expected results when
simulating with no in- or outflows. In the sensitivity analysis, it was also tested what happens
to the models when factoring in 0.92 meters of sea level rise. Lastly, the alternatives were
compared using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to find the best option. The
alternatives were compared on how much they increase flood safety and on how many other
impacts they have on shipping, nature and agriculture and the built environment.
In the end, all of the alternatives showed an increase in flood safety compared to the
current scenario. The alternative that showed the highest increase in flood safety was an
alternative where the Friese Boezem was split up into a Northern Boezem and a Southern
Boezem of roughly equal size, with a new sea pump for the Northern Boezem. When
modeling the Northern Boezem and the Southern Boezem in this alternative they reached a
highest water level of -0.51m NAP and -1.48m NAP respectively. These are only slightly
higher than their target water levels of -0.52m NAP and -1.5m NAP. The simulation of the
current scenario saw a way higher peak, which reached -0.29m NAP with a target water level
of -0.52m NAP. The sensitivity analysis revealed that most alternatives were not sensitive to
small changes in the parameters, and all alternatives gave the expected results during the
degenerate test. When modeling with sea level rise, all alternatives still performed better than
the current scenario. When comparing the alternatives, the aforementioned alternative with a
full split of the boezem with a new sea pump came out on top. This is because while most
other alternatives had less effects on shipping, nature and the built environment, they did not
increase the flood safety by as much. So, splitting up Dutch boezem systems does increase
flood safety, even when factoring in sea level rise. However, this is assuming that the wind
has no effect on the water levels in the boezems.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Rodenhuis, G.I.",June 2025,English,"No.

107216,Raamovereenkomsten in de bouw : Identificatie van kritische succesfactoren voor het behalen van duurzaamheidsdoelstellingen in raamovereenkomsten,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107216,"De constructiesector staat tegenwoordig voor grote uitdagingen. Het tekort aan personeel, gezondheids- en veiligheidszorgen, strengere eisen en toename in kosten vragen om een andere manier van projecten 
aanbesteden. Raamovereenkomsten bieden hiervoor een uitkomst. Raamovereenkomsten, of ook wel 
projectoverstijgende samenwerkingen genoemd, zijn meerderjarige contracten tussen opdrachtgever en 
één of meerdere aannemers waarin alle projecten die binnen die periode vallen door dezelfde aannemer 
gedaan worden. 
Het doel van dit onderzoek is om kritische succesfactoren van een samenwerking binnen 
raamovereenkomsten in kaart te brengen. Hierbij ligt de focus op de programmadoelstellingen op het 
gebied van duurzaamheid. Duurzaamheid is tegenwoordig een belangrijk thema. Opdrachtgevers willen 
ontwikkelen binnen raamovereenkomsten met het oog op het behalen van de SDG’s (Sustainable 
Development Goals). Voor dit onderzoek zijn theoretische kritische succesfactoren onderzocht, die de 
basis voor interviews bij aannemer en opdrachtgever in 3 verschillende raamovereenkomsten vormen. 
In een interne documentenstudie zijn drie casussen waar Strukton Wegen en Beton een raamovereenkomst 
heeft lopen onderzocht. Deze drie onderzochte raamovereenkomsten zijn met een netbeheerder, 
drinkwaterbedrijf en een waterschap. Op het gebied van duurzaamheid willen alle drie de opdrachtgevers 
in 2030 emissieloos bouwen en uitstoot van broeikasgassen verminderen en in 2050 volledig circulair en 
klimaatneutraal zijn. Raamovereenkomsten zouden het ontwikkelen en verbeteren tot deze doelen mogelijk 
maken. Aannemer Strukton Wegen en Beton heeft beloftes en maatregelen aangeboden om deze doelen te 
behalen. In de interviews wordt gekeken naar hoe na de aanbesteding van de raamovereenkomsten deze 
beloftes en maatregelen worden ingevuld, of er focus ligt op het behalen van de doelstellingen en wat 
daaruit volgend factoren zijn voor succes.
Het onderzoek concludeert dat raamovereenkomsten gaan over het organiseren en ontwikkelen en dat dit 
in de praktijk lastiger is dan in theorie en gemaakte afspraken beschreven staat. De belangrijkste kritische 
succesfactoren zijn effectieve communicatie, doelgerichtheid en gedrevenheid. Vindt er geen 
communicatie over doelstellingen plaats of wordt er niet met gedrevenheid doelgericht gewerkt, dan raken 
de doelen uit zicht. Uit de interviews blijkt dat het gevolg hiervan is dat projecten traditioneel uitgevoerd 
neigen te worden. Overige kritische succesfactoren resulterend uit dit onderzoek zijn: focus op continu 
verbeteren, persoonlijke verstandhouding, samenwerking in vroeg stadium, informatie delen en technische 
expertise. Deze succesfactoren hebben allemaal te maken met het organiseren binnen 
raamovereenkomsten. 
De traditionele manier van het bepalen van succes binnen projecten wordt gedaan aan de hand van de ‘iron 
triangle’- factoren tijd, geld en kwaliteit. Dit blijken nog steeds belangrijke condities voor het behalen van 
succes binnen raamovereenkomsten te zijn. Om te ontwikkelen en verbeteren binnen 
raamovereenkomsten moeten deze condities ingevuld worden door middel van de uit dit onderzoek 
resulterende kritische succesfactoren. 
Uit het onderzoek volgt een aanbeveling: Binnen de raamovereenkomst met de netbeheerder zit een 
kwartiermaker die zich bezighoudt met het behalen van de doelstellingen van de raamovereenkomst. Dit 
resulteert in meer toezicht op de beloftes, maatregelen en doelen. Als aanbeveling naar aanleiding van dit

107215,Life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costs (LCC) analysis of adhesives in block glued laminated timber,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107215,"In response to the paradigm shift towards environmentally sustainable practices in the civil engineering 
context, the construction sector is investigating the use of renewable materials such as engineered 
wood products (EWPs). Among these, glued laminated timber (glulam) and its high-capacity variant, 
block glulam, offer promising alternatives due to their carbon storing properties and natural origin. 
However, the adhesives or resins used in their production – mainly formaldehyde-based – pose risks to 
the environment and human health due to toxic emissions. This highlights the need for more 
sustainable adhesives. Despite the growing interest in bio-adhesive alternatives, their application 
remains limited due to insufficient understanding of the environmental and economic consequences 
of these alternatives. Therefore, the goal of this research project is to evaluate and compare the 
environmental and economic impacts of adhesives used in the production of (block) glued laminated 
timber (glulam). The study is conducted by carrying life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) 
analysis and relies on the case study of a pedestrian bridge located in the Netherlands.
Five adhesives are considered in this study, which can be categorised by being synthetic, namely,
melamine-urea formaldehyde (MUF), phenol resorcinol formaldehyde (PRF) and phenol formaldehyde 
(PF); or bio-based: lignin phenol glyoxal (LPG) and tannin-furfuryl alcohol formaldehyde (TFF). The LCA 
stages considered are raw material sourcing, transport to construction site, and three end-of-life 
scenarios (EOL). The environmental assessment relies on the analysis of 1kg of each adhesive, 1m3 of 
glulam per adhesive, and the contextualisation of said impacts on the Zwolle Passarella case study
based on the LCA software Earthster, and database Ecoinvent 3.11. Impacts are assessed according to 
EN 15804+A2 (2019) and the shadow prices calculated via the environmental cost indicator (MKI). A 
sensitivity analysis is carried out to show the sensitivity of the glue content in glulam for the whole life 
cycle. The complementary LCC analysis evaluates the economic impacts of the glulam per adhesive for 
the different EOL scenarios. The sensitivity analysis further assesses the influence of the discount rate 
on the overall LCC results.
The results show that synthetic adhesives have higher environmental impacts on most of the 19 impact 
categories of EN 15804+A2 (2019) and MKI score both for 1kg or their application of 1m3 of glued 
laminated timber, this outcome is more evident when end-of-life benefits of alternatives of bio-adhesives are considered. Adhesives used in glulam contribute about 20% to the environmental 
impacts of raw material sourcing of glulam and 8% to the environmental impacts of their entire life 
cycle. In terms of costs, based on their formulation, 1m3 glulam with synthetic adhesive is more 
expensive than if bio-adhesives are used. However, these differences are not significant as they are 
below 1 Euro as compared to their average of 406 Euros per cubic meter. PRF stands out to have the 
largest impacts both environmental and costs, followed by MUF, while PF’s performance is comparable 
to bio-adhesives, yet it is more expensive than MUF. In contrast, LPG has overall the lowest MKI score
and LCC costs out of the five adhesives considered.
It should be noted that the market availability of synthetic adhesives is greater than for bio-adhesives 
as this is an emerging field. Similarly, the long-term structural implications of synthetic adhesives hold 
less uncertainty because these have been used for decades as compared to bio-adhesives. This makes 
research on their validation paramount for their practical use in the industry. These outcomes reveal 
certain trade-offs: improved structural properties are generally traded off with higher costs of 
environmental impacts of synthetic adhesives, while greater structural consistency and market 
availability is traded-off with the potential lower costs and environmental impacts of bio-adhesives.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Pedrero Zazo, Candela",June 2025,English,"No

Methods: Using a qualitative approach, the study involved a secondary analysis of 11 short documentary videos featuring narratives of Black transracial adoptees and white adoptive parents in the United States. The data was coded and analysed in Atlas.ti through a framework analysis using both predefined and emerging themes, such as experiences of racism, emotional distress, white parents’ awareness, racial identity, and the complex impact of transracial adoption. Results: Black transracial adoptees often encountered racism, identity confusion, and feelings of exclusion. These experiences led to emotional struggles, including sadness, anger, and feeling alone. While some white adoptive parents acknowledged their initial lack of preparedness and later engaged in active learning, others expressed regret over missed opportunities to support their children’s racial identity. Discussion: This study highlights the importance of racial socialization, cultural connection, and mental health support for Black transracial adoptees. To support these Black transracial adoptees, white adoptive parents and professionals need to talk about race, prepare better, and help adoptees stay connected to their culture.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Flokstra, C.M.J.",July 2025,English,"No

It continues on the work of Basarabă, who proposed a tool called StegaScanMail. StegaScanMail has been created to automatically scan email attachments for hidden data, specifically in PNG images. We investigate StegaScanMail for potential improvements, such as enhancing detection accuracy by reducing the number of false positives or expanding its scope by developing a binary classification CNN model for detecting hidden data in JPEG images. To achieve this, we provide an overview of JPEG steganography and steganalysis techniques and tools.
We conclude that, given the current capabilities of StegaScanMail, it is more efficient to create a new tool rather than improve StegaScanMail.
For this, we propose StegaSentinel, a tool that has automated email detection, secure environment creation and secure attachment steganalysis. It aims to provide easy possibilities for integrating various steganalysis techniques into the tool, ensuring relevance as the field progresses.

107209,The Impact of Physical Attractiveness and Type of Crime in Judicial Decision Making,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107209,"Judges and juries are expected to evaluate cases based on legal factors, such as 
severity; however, their judgment is sometimes clouded by extra-legal factors, like the 
defendant's attractiveness and subsequent likability. This can include more lenient sentences 
for attractive defendants, potentially compromising society’s trust in the legal sector. 
However, research is ambiguous, with some finding effects of attractiveness and crime type, 
while others do not. Extending previous work, with this study, the effect of a defendant’s 
physical attractiveness and crime type on sentencing decisions in terms of sentence length 
and perceived seriousness is examined. For this, a 2 (Attractiveness: Attractive vs. 
Unattractive) x 4 (Crime Type: Burglary vs. Swindle vs. Sexual Assault vs. Physical Assault) 
factorial between-subjects mixed-methods study design was used. It was hypothesised that 
there is a difference between attractive and unattractive defendants in sentence length and 
seriousness of crime, depending on crime type, due to the liking-leniency effect and the 
beauty penalty. The results depict no difference in sentencing decisions based on 
attractiveness or its interaction with crime type. However, crime type influenced sentencing 
decisions, with burglary and swindle receiving similar sentence lengths, as did sexual and 
physical assault. The crime types were rated as increasingly serious in the following order: 
burglary, swindle, physical assault and sexual assault. Moreover, utilitarian sentencing 
orientation and gender role beliefs explained part of the variance for sentence length and 
seriousness, with likeability also emerged as a significant covariate of the seriousness of 
crime. Lastly, an exploratory analysis revealed that participants assigned significantly more 
responsibility to the victim in the swindle case, compared to sexual assault.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Nienhaus, Sarah",July 2025,English,"No

107204,Managing midlife: Examining coping strategies of menopausal women using a qualitative study,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107204,"The menopausal transition is a phase all women will experience in their lives. It brings about physical symptoms like hot flashes as well as psychological symptoms such as low mood or concentration problems. To manage the symptoms so greatly affecting women’s lives, menopausal women often make use of coping strategies. While previous research, most frequently cross-sectional, mainly focuses on emotional responses to menopause and discovering coping strategies that are considered effective in reducing symptoms, research lacks an approach in which coping strategies implemented in daily life are examined. Therefore, this study investigated the applied coping strategies of eight (peri)menopausal women by conducting semi-structured interviews. A qualitative interview study approach was chosen to allow for an in-depth understanding of the participants’ experiences, and to allow for elaboration on motivations and personal needs. The interviews lasted about 47-75 minutes per participant, after which the recordings of these were transcribed and coded. Cohen’s kappa was calculated for two large codes. A thematic content analysis on the data brought about four main themes: lifestyle adjustments, emotional coping, gathering relevant information and utilising social support networks. The main findings revealed that women often used multiple coping strategies simultaneously, with particular emphasis on lifestyle adjustments, the role of female peer support and light-hearted emotional coping, such as the implementation of humour, which was not found in prior literature. Implications of the study included sampling bias due to convenience sampling, a sample of solely Western women and a low kappa score for one of the codes. Findings could be implemented in practice by, for instance, establishing support groups. Since this study is merely a snapshot of women’s menopausal experiences, longitudinal studies for future research are recommended.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Boschman, E.",July 2025,English,"No

107203,Optimal transport regularization for implicit neural representations of cell shape sequences,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107203,"The study of living-cell sequences at the microscopic level is critical for advancing our understanding of cell dynamics and interactions. This knowledge is particularly valuable in fields such as disease monitoring and drug development. Despite its importance, high-quality 4D living-cell data remains sparse. Implicit neural representations (INRs) offer a promising solution by enhancing the temporal resolution of the cell shape sequences. However, they often suffer from overfitting to training data. This thesis investigates the application of optimal transport (OT)-based regularization to enhance 3D time-lapse INRs. We propose two regularization methods: one minimizes the Sinkhorn distance between consecutive time points, and the other guides the INR using OT-based interpolations at intermediate time points. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that both methods improve temporal interpolation, reduce output variability, and enhance visual coherence, particularly in modeling bifurcating structures. Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement, especially if the data contains abrupt deformations and high-frequency motion. Additionally, in terms of latent space generalization, the proposed methods did not yield significant benefits. Overall, this work highlights the potential of OT-based methods to improve temporal consistency in 3D time-lapse INRs, especially in structured or moderately complex settings.",Master Applied Mathematics (M-AM),"Martens, T.H.",July 2025,English,"No.

While attachment styles are known to influence romantic relationships, little research has explored their connection to accepting gaslighting behavior. This study investigated whether emotional aspects of attachment—Close, Depend, and Anxiety—are associated with greater acceptance of gaslighting in romantic relationships.
A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with 167 adult participants using the Gaslighting Questionnaire (GQ) and the Revised Adult Attachment Scale (RAAS). Correlation, multiple regression, and moderation analyses were performed to examine relationships between attachment styles, gaslighting acceptance, and socio-demographic variables like gender and educational level.
The analysis revealed no significant correlations between the RAAS subscales and the acceptance of gaslighting. Furthermore, no moderating effects were found for gender or education; participants' educational levels were not significant predictors of gaslighting acceptance.
These findings suggest that emotional attachment dimensions alone cannot adequately explain the acceptance of gaslighting.

Photoplethysmography (PPG) wearables like the Empatica EmbracePlus offer practical benefits for real-world research, but they require validation research to be used confidently. Additionally, virtual reality (VR) provides advantages in laboratory stress research and should be integrated into validation studies. This study aimed to evaluate the validity of the EmbracePlus against a gold standard reference device within a VR-based stress experiment setting, using predefined agreement criteria. Twenty participants were recruited to participate in a VR experiment involving exposure to stress-inducing stimuli while CVA data was collected via the EmbracePlus and gold standard device. Bland-Altman and line plots were used to assess agreement. Results indicated that the EmbracePlus was not valid for HR, standard deviation of RR intervals, or stressor detection. However, it was valid for measuring RMSSD, an HRV measure. The lack of validity was primarily due to the device’s susceptibility to movement and speech artefacts, which compromised the collected data. These findings highlight the need for improved data cleaning and further validation with larger, ethnically diverse samples. Researchers should exercise caution when using the EmbracePlus for certain CVA measures in dynamic VR environments.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Yurdakul, Alp",July 2025,English,"No.

Protection Motivation Theory was utilised to examine the effect of self-efficacy and response efficacy on willingness to intervene. Six different crime vignettes were developed for the experiment, each containing four conditions: control, self-efficacy, response efficacy, and both. The four answer options ranged from doing nothing to intervening, measuring willingness to intervene as an ordinal variable. Self-efficacy was found to significantly influence the likelihood of intervening, either alone or combined with response efficacy. Response efficacy itself did not show any significant effect. Additionally, the perceived realism of the vignettes increased the willingness to intervene. Overall, the findings illustrate that the belief in one’s capability outweighs the belief in the effectiveness of the action.

DHL eCommerce Benelux is expanding its parcel locker network as part of this trend, yet current locker placement decisions rely heavily on intuition rather than data. In this thesis, we develop a data-driven optimisation model to support strategic decisions on the placement and sizing of parcel lockers. We formulate this as a novel variation of the facility location problem, the Last Mile Capacitated Parcel Locker Location Problem (LMCPLLP), and solve it using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming approach. Our model integrates real-world complexities, such as variable locker types, fallback delivery options, historical pickup behaviour, and region-specific pickup radii. We apply the model to real data from DHL and design experiments across multiple regions to test performance, robustness, scalability and provide managerial insights. Experiments demonstrate cost savings of 18–22%, highlighting the practical value of the optimisation framework.

Despite its growing relevance, research on gaslighting remains limited, particularly in relation to the personality traits that may influence individuals’ acceptance of such behaviours. This study explored whether the Big Five personality traits, as well as a dependent personality profile, are associated with gaslighting acceptance. A cross-sectional design was used with a sample of adult participants who completed a gaslighting acceptance questionnaire and a brief personality inventory. The dependent personality profile was defined by a trait combination identified in prior research: high agreeableness, high neuroticism, and low openness. Findings revealed that higher levels of agreeableness and openness were associated with lower acceptance of gaslighting behaviours. No meaningful associations were found for neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, or the dependent profile. These results suggest that certain traits may serve as protective factors against the normalisation of manipulative relational dynamics.

However, such policy shifts raise concerns about the potential impact of aging on core cognitive functions, particularly sustained attention. This study investigates whether sustained attention declines with age, using two tasks: the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) and Mackworth’s Clock Test (MCT), administered to 29 participants across three age groups (18–44, 45–54, 55–65). Performance was measured using d-prime (d′) scores, alongside secondary measures including eye-tracking data and self-reported measurements. Contrary to initial hypotheses and background neuroscientific expectations, results revealed no significant decline in sustained attention across age groups. In fact, older participants performed comparably or slightly better than their younger counterparts in some cases. Regression analyses also indicated that perceived task difficulty significantly predicted performance. These findings challenge assumptions about cognitive aging and suggest that older adults may retain the capacity to perform attentionally demanding tasks, particularly when bolstered by experience or adaptive strategies.

Research to improve STN-DBS requires a brain template that serves as a common space to perform group analyses. Existing templates are unsuitable for STN-DBS-eligible patients due to the population, sample size and MRI sequence they are based on. To address this, the NTN-PD-DBS-230 brain template was developed, based on MRI data from 230 patients who underwent STN-DBS-surgery at the Radboudumc. The template is available in both a T1-weighted and T2-weighted version with isotropic resolutions of 1.1 mm and 0.5 mm. Evaluation showed superior inter-subject similarity compared to 12 of 14 existing templates (p<0.0003). The T2-weighted 0.5 mm version also outperformed five of eight templates in atlas-based segmentation accuracy (p<0.001). These results demonstrate that the PD-DBS more accurately represents the anatomy of STN-DBS-eligible PD patients and offers improved registration performance. While promising, further recommendations include updating the high-resolution template, external validation and re-assessment of data saturation.

107190,"The Effect of Showing Ability-Related Vulnerability and Emotional Vulnerability on Well-Being, Support and Self-Esteem Among University Students",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107190,"University students are exposed to psychological distress. Showing vulnerability would be expected to enhance university students’ mental health positively. Showing vulnerability is defined as voluntary emotional exposure despite fears and risks of doing that. Although showing vulnerability includes various types and behaviours of it, the distinction within the behaviours has not been made yet. Therefore, categorisation of ability-related vulnerability and emotional vulnerability is created for this study. Hence, the aim of this research is to investigate “How are ability-related vulnerability and emotional vulnerability related to students’ psychological well-being, self-esteem, and support?” The method of this study is a one-time questionnaire. It consists of a vignette study, questions for both types of vulnerabilities, scales for well-being, support and self-esteem. The sample of this study was 65 University of Twente students recruited by voluntary and snowballing sampling methods. Overall, this study confirms the significant relation between both types of vulnerability and well-being, support and self-esteem. By comparing the strengths of both vulnerabilities towards dependent variables, ability-related vulnerability relates more to well-being and self-esteem, and both types of vulnerability relate to support. The gender differences between males and females, which were expected, are not confirmed in either vulnerability. This research demonstrates the relation between ‘showing vulnerability’ and various psychological aspects of university students’ lives. It suggests the potential benefits of intervention in inducing the behaviours of showing each type of vulnerability for university students to enhance their mental health and quality of life.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Ishida, Moe",July 2025,English,"No

107188,Cybersecuritytrainingen in de zorg : Een meta-analyse naar de effectiviteit van verschillende bezorgingsmethoden op leerresultaten en gedragsverandering bij zorgmedewerkers,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107188,"Het Nederlandse zorgstelsel behoort internationaal gezien tot de beste ter wereld. Op het gebied
van toegankelijkheid en betaalbaarheid van de zorg staat Nederland in de top 3 (Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and DevelopmentOECD, 2023; Schneider e.a., 2021). Ook op kwaliteit
scoort Nederland bovengemiddeld voor zowel eerste- en tweedelijnszorg (OECD, 2023). Mede hierdoor wordt het Nederlandse systeem vaak aangehaald als voorbeeld voor andere landen.
Ondanks dat Nederland internationaal goed scoort, lopen we ook tegen problemen aan in de
zorg. Zo staat de betaalbaarheid, waar Nederland momenteel internationaal gezien goed op scoort
(OECD, 2023), onder druk. De totale zorgkosten van de overheid nemen structureel jaarlijks toe.
In 2024 waren de totale zorguitgaven AC97,8 miljard. De verwachting is dat dit in 2028 oploopt
tot AC120,6 miljard (Ministerie van Financien, 2024). Bovendien staat de capaciteit van de zorg
onder druk, waardoor de wachttijden voor diagnostiek en behandeling in de medisch-specialistische
zorg de afgelopen jaren een recordhoogte hebben bereikt (De Staat van Volksgezondheid en Zorg,
2025a, 2025b).
Aan de ene kant zorgen personeelstekorten voor de toenemende druk op de zorg. De verwachting is dat het personeelstekort toeneemt van 54.000 in 2024 naar ongeveer 270.000 in 2034
(Prognosemodel Zorg en Welzijn, 2024). Aan de andere kant neemt ook de vraag naar zorg toe.
De levensverwachting stijgt en zit inmiddels op 80,3 jaar voor mannen en 83,3 jaar voor vrouwen
(vzinfo, 2024a). Daarnaast neemt het aantal chronisch zieke mensen en mensen met multimorbiditeit toe (vzinfo, 2024b).
Digitalisering wordt gezien als een cruciaal onderdeel van een toekomstbestendig zorgsysteem
dat zowel de toegankelijkheid als de kwaliteit waarborgt. Digitale zorg heeft de potentie om de
productiviteit van het zorgpersoneel te verhogen en zo de toegankelijkheid en betaalbaarheid te
waarborgen (Rutten e.a., 2025). Voorbeelden van digitale zorg ofwel eHealth zijn: een elektronisch
pati¨entendossier, een online afspraak met de dokter, sensoren voor thuismonitoring of schoonmaakrobots (Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en SportVWS, 2018).
De digitalisering van de zorg brengt echter ook grote risico’s met zich mee. Zorginstellingen
worden steeds vaker doelwit van cyberaanvallen, wat kan leiden tot ernstige datalekken waarbij
gevoelige persoonlijke informatie op straat belandt. Daarnaast kunnen ransomware of DDoS-aanvallen er zelfs voor zorgen dat de zorgverlening (tijdelijk) volledig stil komt te liggen (Z-Cert,
2024). Uit onderzoek blijkt dat mensen vaak de zwakste schakel vormen bij het voorkomen van
cybersecurity-incidenten (Nobles, 2018; Triplett, 2022). Zo klikken medewerkers regelmatig op
onveilige links in e-mails, gebruiken zij zwakke wachtwoorden of maken ze geen gebruik van two-factor-authentication (Z-Cert, 2022).
Cybersecurity trainingen zijn belangrijk voor het bijbrengen van kennis bij zorgpersoneel, om
zo de menselijke fouten te voorkomen (Coventry & Branley, 2018). Helaas kampen deze trainingen
vaak met een lage deelname, doordat ze niet goed aansluiten op de behoefte van de doelgroep. Dit
zorgt voor lage motivatie en betrokkenheid onder de deelnemers (Chowdhury & Gkioulos, 2023;
Prummer e.a., ¨ 2024).
Belangrijk is om de trainingen meer aan te laten sluiten op de behoefte en voorkeuren van de
deelnemers, in dit geval zorgmedewerkers. Volgens onderzoek door van Zee (2024) verhogen specifieke attributen van cybersecuritytrainingen de bereidheid van zorgmedewerkers om hieraan deel te
nemen. De volgende attributen zijn daarbij ge¨ıdentificeerd: sessieduur en frequentie, leermethode,
hoeveelheid samenwerking vereist, bezorgingsmethode en compensatie (van Zee, 2024). Bij deze
set attributen is gekeken naar de attribuutniveaus waaraan zij de voorkeur geven. Er is echter niet
gekeken of deze daadwerkelijk bijdragen aan betere leerresultaten of gedragsverandering. Het is
bijvoorbeeld mogelijk dat een aantrekkelijk gevonden attribuut in de praktijk juist een negatieve of
verwaarloosbare invloed heeft op het leerproces of het gedrag van medewerkers. Om uiteindelijk een
effectieve cybersecuritytraining te ontwikkelen, is het daarom belangrijk om ook de daadwerkelijke
effectgroottes van deze attributen te onderzoeken, zodat de volgende vraag beantwoord kan worden:
“Wat is de effectgrootte van de verschillende niveaus van de trainingsattributen — zoals sessieduur en frequentie, leermethode, hoeveelheid samenwerking, bezorgingsmethode en compensatie —
op leerresultaten en gedragsverandering bij zorgmedewerkers, en in hoeverre komen deze overeen
3
met de voorkeuren zoals vastgesteld door van Zee (2024)?”
Dit onderzoek richt zich op de effectiviteit van verschillende bezorgingsmethoden binnen cybersecuritytrainingen, en vormt daarmee een eerste stap in het beantwoorden van de bredere vraag
naar de effectiviteit van trainingsattributen. Er is specifiek gekozen voor de bezorgingsmethode
omdat deze in de praktijk vaak het meest zichtbaar ´en het gemakkelijkst aanpasbaar is. Daarnaast beïnvloedt dit attribuut in hoge mate de wijze waarop andere elementen zoals de mate van
samenwerking en de leermethode vorm krijgen; een training via een app biedt immers andere mogelijkheden dan een fysieke sessie. Dit leidt tot de volgende onderzoeksvraag:
Wat is het effect van verschillende bezorgingsmethoden (via app, website of fysieke locatie) op
de leerresultaten en gedragsverandering van zorgmedewerkers in het kader van cybersecuritytrainingen?",Bachelor Health Sciences (B-GZW),"Tenhage, T.",July 2025,Dutch,"No.

107187,What Mechanisms Drive Positive Group Treatment Outcomes in Compassion-Focused Therapy for PTSD Patients According to Therapists? : A Qualitative Interview Study,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107187,"Group Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT) is a third-wave cognitive behavioural 
approach that aims to increase resilience and psychological flexibility, counteracting constructs 
such as guilt, shame, and self-criticism. For individuals with PTSD, these constructs are proven to 
be overdeveloped. Previous research has shown the effectiveness of group CFT in increasing 
psychological flexibility and resilience for individuals with a PTSD diagnose. Yet, limited research 
has been conducted on what working mechanisms drive positive group change in group-based CFT 
for individuals with PTSD, from a therapist perspective. This study aimed to discover what 
mechanisms of group-based CFT drive positive change for individuals with PTSD, according to 
therapists. This study followed a qualitative approach by conducting six semi-structured interviews 
with professionals who practice group CFT for individuals with PTSD, followed by a thematic 
analysis. The analysis identified five key themes according to the data given by the participants: 
(1) internalising compassion, (2) emotional openness and safety, (3) the group as a corrective 
relational space, (4) the therapist as compassionate co-regulator and educator, and (5) readiness

Rather than addressing burnout once it has occurred, Burnout Quest aims to build early awareness and strategy use through interactive, metaphor-based minigames. The mobile prototype incorporates psychological skills such as boundary-setting and self-compassion in a game-based format designed to  encourage reflection. A mixed-methods evaluation with 15 students involved pre- and post-session questionnaires measuring state anxiety and confidence in strategy use, as well as qualitative feedback on the app’s gamified features. Results showed a significant decrease in anxiety and a large increase in self-reported confidence after a single session.

This study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to examine neural responses to social animations in virtual reality (VR), comparing geometric shapes and humanoid avatars adapted from the classic Heider and Simmel (1944) paradigm. In a within-subjects lab design, participants (N = 30) viewed both animation types while fNIRS recorded activation in Theory of Mind (ToM) regions: medial Pre-Frontal Cortex, Anterior Temporal Lobe, Superior Temporal Sulcus, and Temporoparietal Junction. Participants also provided narrative interpretations and confidence ratings. Both conditions elicited significant ToM-related activations compared to baseline, with the strongest effects in the Superior Temporal Sulcus (geometric: p < .001, d = 0.83; humanoid: p = .002, d = 0.77). Humanoid avatars produced 50% more coded narrative content than geometric shapes (p < .001), yet no significant neural activation differences between animation types were found across any ToM region (all p > .38), nor in confidence ratings (p = .79). Thematic analysis revealed similar interpretive patterns across conditions, suggesting motion cues alone suffice to trigger social cognitive processes.

To secure these devices, various analyses, including static and fuzz-testing (fuzzing), are developed to identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited. One key area of research is Memory Mapped Input-Output (MMIO), as these enable untrusted input from peripherals (such as Bluetooth and Ethernet) to reach the CPU. A common approach researchers use to extract MMIO addresses is to manually look them up in datasheets and other types of documentation. This is possible when analysing minimal amounts of firmware. However, this will be challenging to do when we need to examine them in bulk. Additionally, when the microcontroller~(MCU) is unknown, we are also unable to locate its datasheet, making MMIO address lookups impossible. To facilitate analysis in these situations, we developed XtractIO, which automatically locates MMIO addresses in non-Linux firmware. Our approach uses patterns to locate MMIO operations, after which it extracts the referenced addresses. We evaluated our approach against a set of 40 firmware images consisting of ARM Cortex-M and Xtensa architectures. XtractIO performs, on average, 30 per cent better compared to a naive approach. However, even though XtractIO outperforms a naive approach, it still has an average F1-score of 60 to 70 per cent, indicating that it still produces both false positives and negatives.

107176,Navigating Change : A Qualitative Study of Women’s Coping Strategies During the Menopausal Transition,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107176,"The menopausal transition is accompanied by a variety of physical and psychological 
challenges for women, including symptoms such as hot flashes, mood changes, and sleep 
disturbances. Other factors coinciding with this life phase, like the loss of parents or children 
leaving home, add further stress to the situation. Despite the evident need for effective coping 
strategies to manage these stressors, the ways in which women navigate perimenopause
remain underexplored in research. This study investigates how women manage the 
menopausal transition and cope with the demands of this phase of life. For this purpose, eight 
semi-structured interviews were conducted with women living in Germany. Data was
analysed using inductive thematic analysis, identifying five themes: Symptom Management, 
Lifestyle, Support, Stress Management, and Emotional Coping. Two main findings emerged. 
First, participants mostly used problem-focused coping, such as information gathering, 
adapting their lifestyle, and seeking medical treatments. Emotion-focused coping strategies, 
such as acceptance and relaxation, were used less frequently. This might be connected to the 
perceived severity of the symptoms the women experienced. Second, all participants 
expressed ambivalence toward the use of hormone therapy. All eight women voiced similar 
concerns regarding a heightened risk for cancer and potentially harmful side effects. Most of 
these concerns were based on outdated information that has since been partially revised. The 
findings emphasize potential benefits for women using a more balanced approach to coping
during perimenopause, including problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies.

It was hypothesized that (1) victims would show a stronger preference for restorative justice and a weaker preference for retributive justice and (2) this relationship would be mediated by moral outrage (linked to retributive justice) and the needs for communion and agency (linked to restorative justice). To examine these hypotheses, an experiment was set up in which participants were randomly allocated to a victim (N=100) or bystander (N=96) condition in which they were asked to imagine a scenario of being the victim or bystander of a case of toxic leadership in a sports association and then indicated their preferred justice response. A linear regression- and mediation analysis suggested nuanced results. Hypothesis 1 was rejected as, in contrast to predictions, there was no significant effect between position to incident and justice response. However, a tendency was observed as participants of the victim group tended to prefer a restorative justice response more than those in the bystander group. Hypothesis 2 was also rejected as none of the mediators had an indirect effect as predicted. Unexpectedly, participants of the victim group did report a stronger moral outrage level than those in the bystander group, which, in turn, predicted a stronger retributive justice response. It was concluded that victims tended to favor restorative over retributive justice. However, victim’s retributive justice response was also enhanced through a stronger moral outrage level than for bystanders. These findings underline how more variables, such as time since offense and the changing sports culture, need to be taken into consideration for decision-making within sports culture and future studies. The level of moral outrage is different between victims and bystanders and might change over time. It is recommended that moral outrage for victims of toxic leadership is to be examined further in the sports domain.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Fobbe, M.",July 2025,English,"No

107170,The Community of Practice 'Dikes & Nature' : a qualitative analysis of collaboration and transition processes,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107170,"Dike reinforcement is needed in the Netherlands due to climate change and rising sea levels. However, 
these dike reinforcements projects could take place in protected natural areas. This results in 
discussion on how dike reinforcement structures can be built with the needs of the environment taken 
into account. Therefore, in 2022 the Community of Practice Dikes & Nature has been established to 
address this problem. This is a collaboration that was introduced by the National Flood Protection 
Program (NFPP) in 2022. With the help of this Community of Practice (CoP), the NFPP wanted to form 
an answer to the question of how dike reinforcement can be implemented in natural areas (Natura 
2000). However, this Community has not defined a future structure on how to continue, due to the 
ending of the overall project of the NFPP in 2024. Therefore, the project team is looking for 
opportunities to continue the collaboration and to keep the community alive. 
The topic of dike reinforcement implementation in nature-based areas is still a relevant topic that 
needs attention. Therefore, the CoP (leaders) want to make sure the transition in this field keeps going 
with the base they built in their collaboration. This results in the following research question: “How 
can the Community of Practice Dikes & Nature transition to a new collaborative to continue cocreating 
and disseminating knowledge for the integration of flood management and nature-based solutions in 
dike reinforcement projects?”
With this pending question, research on three different topics is needed to write a recommendation
about the possibilities of continuation of this technical Community of Practice. With the help of three 
theoretical perspectives in literature (transition paths, the collaboration life cycle and other forms of 
collaboration (also known as learning communities)) the basis for this research is built. The next step 
was to set up a focus group and conduct interviews to verify if the insights of the literature review are 
applicable and relevant to the CoP Dikes & Nature.
The results in this research are based on the collaboration life cycle (phases where a collaboration 
goes through in their process). An important finding is therefore that the Community of Practice Dikes 
& Nature spent some time in each of the phases, but for some of the phases they did not take the 
time they needed. This resulted in that the next phase did not have enough foundation to be 
completed in the most optimal way. To be precise, the CoP did not spent enough time in the issue 
phase and the assembly and structure phase (the phases where the problem and the boundaries of 
the project are defined). Which resulted in confusion in the next phase (productivity phase). With the 
result of a group of participants that were involved and informed each on different levels.
Moreover, by structuring the collaboration (in some kind of form) and choosing a path that will help
to start and keep an implementation of a solution possible (transition paths) the overall productivity 
might increase. Therefore, it is advised to go back to the issue phase and take the time needed. This 
research offers a complete model that could guide the Community of Practice Dikes & Nature through 
this process.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Vries, R. de",June 2025,English,"No

(2023)). Because of this, bicycle traffic must be taken into consideration during the decision process
regarding (bicycle) infrastructure. Witteveen+Bos has developed the Fietsmonitor to assist stakeholders in this process.
The Fietsmonitor is a computer tool that makes predictions on the bicycle traffic in a city using
OD-matrices and a ’shortest-path’ route choice model. Previous studies, such as Van Nijen et al.,
(2024), have found that many more decision variables also impact route choice besides travel distance.
This knowledge called for an improvement of the Fietsmonitor: a calibration tool that connects the
traffic predictions to the observed bicycle traffic in a city.
In this thesis, a calibration tool for the Fietsmonitor is developed, while taking into account the uncertainties in the available input data: the OD-matrix and the observed count data. The calibration
tool uses a machine learning approach through gradient descent in order to optimize the uncertain
parameters. It does this through four different types of calibration: the route choice probabilities, the
traffic within each OD-pair, the overall OD-matrix, and the observed count data.
The model performs best if the route choice probabilities are initialized as equal over the different
routes, the probabilities are normalized through a standard normalization function, and a learning rate
of 0.1 is used. A sensitivity analysis has shown that the calibration tool is robust to changes in the
input data.
In the end, the calibration tool managed to bring a mean absolute error of 610 bicycles down to a
mean absolute error of only 64 bicycles in 100 iterations. This is a significantly better prediction of the
bicycle traffic compared to the original Fietsmonitor. Thus, the developed calibration tool was found
to be a valuable addition to the Fietsmonitor.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Velden, J.M.T. van der",June 2025,English,"Yes

tedious aspects of learning a new language. Literature suggests that performing intuitive gestures and learning in an immersive virtual reality
(IVR) environment is beneficial for vocabulary acquisition. In this study,
I create an IVR environment where Japanese words can be learned in
an engaging way by exploring the world and selecting target objects. 19
students of the University of Twente learned 54 Japanese words divided
over three learning conditions: 1) an immersive world, where the participant performs intuitive gestures, 2) an immersive world, where only
the target word is shown, and 3) an empty world, where the participant
performs gestures as well. The study focuses on how these conditions
affect immersion and cognitive load during learning, and how they influence short-term and long-term learning outcomes. The participants were
tested on their recall memory of the words after each learning condition,
and again after one week on all of the words. The results suggest that
learning in a contextual world increases the immersion felt, but the performance of gestures does not significantly impact the immersion. There
is no significant difference in the cognitive load experienced across all conditions. It appears that the increase in immersion due to the contextual
world, with the seemingly limited effects of the cognitive load, affects both
short-term acquisition as well as long-term word retention. The performance of gestures shows no significant difference compared to where no
gestures are performed. This shows that an immersive environment aids
language learning, which is promising for the potential application of IVR
for language learning in classrooms.",Bachelor Advanced Technology (B-AT),"Slots, Finn",June 2025,English,"No

107165,The influence of co-construction and collaborative problem solving in a collaborative team task,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107165,"Introduction: Working in teams has been a central part of how organizations organize activities, that is seen even more often in the 21st century. Working in teams is also powerful for learning as it can facilitate and stimulate a multitude of behaviours, such as collaborative problem solving. To have an effective team learning process, it is necessary to have an environment where communication between members in which behaviours such as co-construction are present. The goal of this study is to observe how actual collaborative problem solving and co-construction evolve over time in a collaborative team task.
Methods: Data was collected from 16 participants that were part of four teams consisting of three or five participants. All teams participated in a collaborative task where they had to rank items based on the survival probability in an imagined scenario where they had to visualise themselves lost at sea and trying to reach the shore, first individually, then in a team. They were given a list of items that were saved from the boat, and the task was to rank these items based on how it would help them survive. At the end, their ranking was compared to the one done by the coast guards. Throughout this task, the participants were video recorded. In addition, participants were required to complete a questionnaire, to collect demographic information.
Results: The ranking results showed that only two teams survived and 7 out of 16 participants survived individually. The timelines of the video-coded co-construction and CPS behaviours that were made showed that in the two teams that did survive the task there was almost a pattern between the behaviour’s idea development and idea explanation. Moreover, behaviours such as off-topic conversation and loss in detail and repetition seem to be necessary for achieving a good result as they balance out the conversation between participants.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Atanasiu-Raileanu, Cristina-Ioana",June 2025,English,"No

107163,Predicting the volume of cyclists at road segments based on environmental characteristics,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107163,"In the Netherlands the number is cyclists is significant and expected to grow even further in the 
coming years. This makes it important for municipalities and other policy makers to have an 
insight cyclist intensities, as they can use this information when new developments aƯecting 
cyclists are made. Currently, models that estimate cyclist intensities often use the four step 
model as their core approach, which estimates the shortest route between the origin and 
destination of a trip. In research it was found that many trips do not follow the shortest route, but 
are instead influenced by environmental factors to take a diƯerent route (De Jong et al., 2023). 
Models that follow a spatial planning approach, which are often used to estimate pedestrian 
intensities use only environmental characteristics to predict and could be a solution to this 
problem. An example of a model that functions as such is the Loopmonitor of Witteveen+Bos, 
which predicts pedestrian intensities. 
In this research it was evaluated if a model that only took into account environmental 
characteristics, like the Loopmonitor, can predict cyclist intensities on a case study of 
Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. Based on a literature study relevant characteristics that aƯect 
cyclists were determined, whilst also characteristics that are used in spatial planning analyses 
were found. These characteristics were used in a regression model, where Random Forest 
regression was found to be the most suitable regression type. 
The findings from the regression model reveal that network characteristics were the most 
influential, whilst infrastructural characteristics had very little eƯect on the model results. In the 
validation of the results a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 436 cyclists on a daily basis was found, 
with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) being 681. These errors were more significant for 
locations with many cyclists. In a comparison with a four step model, the Fietsmonitor of 
Witteveen+Bos it was found that the constructed model has a greater predictive capability on 
Apeldoorn. 
From this research it is furthermore recommended to incorporate network analysis more into 
research related to predicting cyclist intensities, as these were determined to be very impactful 
in this study. Lastly, it is recommended to compare the model and the Fietsmonitor again on a 
diƯerent city, so that an independent comparison can also be made about the accuracies of 
both models.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Witjes, F.L.D.",July 2025,English,"No.

It is part of a bigger study that investigates primary and secondary stressors in students during the COVID-19 pandemic and utilises a cross-sectional correlational quantitative study design. The sample comprised 444 participants. The results indicated that while there are significant relationships between general anxiety and loneliness and IU, COVID-related anxiety is not related to loneliness. Some (marginally) significant mediations indicate a mediating effect of IU on loneliness and COVID-related anxiety, while non-significant moderations show no effect of housing situation.

107158,Evaluation of the Local Cooling Effect of Existing Green-Blue Infrastructure in Hengelo Trough Thermal Walks,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107158,"As urban temperatures are on the rise with global warming and further urbanization, cities are under 
growing pressure to integrate effective heat mitigation measures. Recently, the municipality of Hengelo 
implemented several projects using green-blue infrastructure (GBI) to mitigate heat and enhance 
thermal comfort in urban areas. Yet, so far, no local evidence-based assessment of their real cooling 
performance has taken place.
This bachelor thesis examined the performance of five types of GBI in the city centre of Hengelo: sparsecanopy trees, water pond, dense-canopy trees, water fountain, and green square. The chosen methodology 
was a thermal walk that combined quantitative data gathered with the Kestrel 5400 sensors and 
qualitative data from questionnaires filled in by the participants. 
Key findings indicated that dense-canopy trees were the most effective intervention, lowering Wet Bulb 
Globe Temperature (WBGT) by up to 5.3 °C and having the highest comfort ratings. Sparse-canopy 
trees also provided substantial cooling (up to 4.1 °C decrease in WBGT) and are more feasible to plant 
with their lower spatial requirements and easier to implement in narrower streets of Hengelo’s city centre. 
The green square presented moderate cooling and mostly positive thermal comfort ratings, although, its 
use is spatially and financially constrained. Water features were less effective, since the sensors at the 
water pond recorded consistent warming effects despite positive feedback from the participants, while 
the water fountain recorded measurable cooling, but had low perceived comfort, as it lacked shade and 
surrounding vegetation.
While this study provides strong indicative evidence, its conclusions are based on two thermal walks 
conducted under specific weather conditions and with a limited number of participants. Future studies 
involving more diverse groups and broader seasonal conditions would help confirm and expand upon 
these findings.
The study concludes that the success of GBI is not just a factor of the type of infrastructure, but of 
context-specific integration. This study provides the municipality of Hengelo with its first localized 
information upon which to base future planning. It suggests that dense-canopy trees receive priority in 
open areas, with sparse-canopy trees serving as an acceptable alternative for smaller and narrower urban 
areas. Water features are only to be introduced in conjunction with vegetation and shade, and in the 
form of fountains rather than stagnant ponds. Green squares are most valuable where multirecreational 
public space usage justifies the added expense and space requirements.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Oldak, K.M.",June 2025,English,"No.

Traditional methods often face challenges in unifying these aspects and explicitly modeling the objects at risk within a system. The WATCHDOG framework addresses these challenges by introducing object-oriented DisruptiOn Graphs (DOGs). DOGs combine fault trees, attack trees, and object graphs to provide a comprehensive modeling approach. To reason about these DOGs, WATCHDOG has DOGLog, a specialized three-layered logic. This thesis details the design and implementation of a model checker for DOGLog. The core contribution is the development and implementation of model checking algorithms for DOGLog, which utilize Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and Multi-Terminal BDDs (MTBDDs) for efficient analysis. The developed algorithms support DOGLog's three layers: Boolean disruption propagation, probability calculations, and object-specific risk computations. The practical utility of DOGLog is demonstrated through a comprehensive case study of a cyber-physical pipeline system. This case study illustrates how ODF, the implemented tool, is used to analyze complex risk scenarios, identify optimal system configurations, and aid in the validation and refinement of risk models by uncovering subtle modeling issues.

The experiments were separated into two sections, small problems and large problems. There were a total of 75 LeetCode problems to determine small problem performance. Models were assessed based on accuracy and code quality, with measures such as maintainability index, source lines of code, and cyclomatic complexity as indicators of the code quality produced. The results found that OpenAI's o1-mini had the best accuracy, while Claude 3.7 Sonnet produced the highest quality code overall. GPT-4o-mini performed significantly worse than the other models. For the large problems, five unique tasks were chosen across various programming languages and project types. The models tested in these experiments were OpenAI o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Each solution was assessed based on functional correctness, maintainability, and ease of prompting the model. All of the experiments were done in an agentic manner using the Cursor IDE.

A significant positive relationship was found between perceived severity and protective behaviour, response efficacy and protective behaviour, and a significant negative relationship between perceived costs and protective behaviour. No significant relationships were found between other predictors and protective behaviour. Limitations consisted of a predominantly Dutch sample with potential language comprehension issues, the use of self-report data, a reverse-worded benefits construct, and the relatively low reliability of the protective behaviour measure. Despite these limitations, the study found that perceived severity, response efficacy, and perceived costs predicted protective behaviour against hypernudging, while awareness and other PMT factors did not. The results stress the importance of focusing on perceived severity, response efficacy, and perceived costs, rather than awareness to increase protective behaviour.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Elfrink, L.L.T.",July 2025,English,"No

107143,Validating Accuracy of Embrace Plus in Measuring Electrodermal Activity During VR Stress Induction,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107143,"Wearables have become widely used tools in ambulatory psychophysiological research and stress research. However, concerns remain about their accuracy in measuring stress-related responses, especially electrodermal activity (EDA), since the wrist placement can hinder accurate measurements due to a lower density of sweat glands. Therefore, multiple studies have tried to validate these devices, finding issues in the sensitivity for smaller stressors. Using Virtual Reality (VR) for this validation offers a safe, standardised way to test stress responses, especially when using more acute stressors. Therefore, this study aims to validate the accuracy of the Embrace Plus in measuring EDA compared to a golden standard using the three-level framework from Van Lier et al. (2019) including the signal level (overall shape and timing), the parameter level (accuracy of measured parameters) and the event level (across scenarios). The participants were exposed to the VR version of the TSST and a virtual height exposure scenario. As expected, at the signal level, agreement between the devices was low (M=0.05). At the parameter level, the Embrace Plus underestimated all three parameters, with the number of SCRs being the most accurate, with a moderate agreement, against previous expectations. For the event-level, responses for the phases were detected by the wearable, but the responses were significantly less prominent. All in all, the results suggest that the Embrace Plus consistently underestimates EDA and cannot accurately detect all trends. These results may be caused by a misalignment of the devices, caused by a temporal difference between the two.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Homann, Theresa",June 2025,English,"No

107141,The Role of Perceived Controllability on the Use of Acceptance and Problem-Solving as Coping Strategies and Their Impact on Positive Affect: Navigating Daily-Life Stress,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107141,"Background. Stress in daily-life situations can affect the emotional well-being, this depends on how individuals appraise and cope with the stressful situations. Acceptance and problem solving are commonly studied coping strategies because they impact two different approaches of coping, namely emotion-focused and problem-focused coping. Perceived controllability of stressful situations may influence whether individuals choose one coping strategy over another, which also impacts well-being. Methods. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) was used in this study, with 39 participants filling in multiple questionnaires during the day assessing perceived controllability, coping strategy use and positive affect of stressful situations. Two mixed-effect logistic models tested the association between controllability and coping strategy selection. Additionally, two time-lagged linear mixed-effects models tested whether controllability moderated for acceptance and problem solving on next-moment positive affect. Results. There was no significant relation between perceived controllability and use of acceptance or problem solving. Also, there was no significant relationship between perceived controllability of a stressful situation, the coping strategy used and positive affect. Discussion. The findings suggest that perceived controllability may not determine coping strategy selection, nor does it moderate positive affect. The null findings stem from measurement limitations, uncontrolled stressor variability and sample size constraints.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Brinkman, Lisa",July 2025,English,"No

Although access to lifestyle data has increased through self-tracking tools, research shows that these tools often fail to support reflection and insight. A contextmapping study was conducted to understand how Dutch older adults (aged 50–70) interpret and act upon lifestyle-related data. The study found that while participants already reflected on some lifestyle measures such as stress, weight, sleep, and steps, only few used tools to interpret this data. Based on these findings, two prototypes were designed and evaluated. The first prototype is a metaphorical, low-fidelity prototype based on a painting, which triggered quick interpretations but led to confusion due to its unclear visual elements. The second prototype, a Mondriaan-inspired hi-fi prototype, improved glanceability and recognizability, but it lacked clarity in how data corresponded to visual changes. While both prototypes supported low-effort reflection, they did not consistently help users gain meaningful insights. The findings from this thesis suggest that designing for insight-generation requires a balance of low-effort, glanceability, and understandability.

One underexplored factor potentially influencing this is value congruence—how professional values align with attitudes toward technology. This study investigated whether psychology students’ professional values shape their attitudes toward digital technologies in therapeutic settings. A cross-sectional online survey (N = 48) was conducted among psychology and communication science students, assessing demographics, digital literacy, professional values, and value-based technology attitudes. Data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis, reliability testing, correlations, and multiple regression, with digital literacy as a control variable. Three distinct factors each were identified for both values and attitudes. Regression results showed that “Social Orientation” significantly predicted “Digital Opportunities for Growth and Compassionate Care” (β = .41, p = .005), and both “Integrity” and “Social Orientation” predicted “Digital Ethical Practice” (β = .40, p = .008; β = .30, p = .039).

Based on the literature about cultural and utilitarian factors and their effect on cross-border shopping, a semi-structured interviewing technique was used to interview participants. The findings reveal that price advantages and product availability are primary motivations for cross-border trips. Dutch customers were found to be very solution-orientated, always seeking immediate and effective solutions to their needs. Cultural factors such as valuing the quality of life played a more subtle but still important role. None of the interviewees perceived any advertising efforts from German retailers, disclosing the potential of marketing unused.
Thus, Dutch consumers primarily engage in cross-border shopping in Germany due to practical, price-driven motivations. However, cultural nuances still shape their overall shopping experience, offering German retailers valuable opportunities to increase visits, spending, and loyalty through marketing retail strategies tailored to the investigated needs and preferences of Dutch customers in Germany.

While this approach can improve performance, it may also negatively impact how athletes experience their sport. We highlight the lack of subjective metrics in self-tracking technology and their potential to enhance the Sport-Data Experience (SDX). To address this, we explored opportunities to enhance the SDX and identified interoceptive awareness as an area to focus on. Next, we selected a suitable subjective metric designed to help increase this awareness and used it to develop an intervention, which we implemented within a smartwatch-based self-tracking application for use during running. Finally, we evaluated this intervention using a mixed-methods evaluation involving 21 participants in which we compared a baseline group with the intervention group. Results show a statistically significant increase in interoceptive awareness in the intervention group (r = .44), supported by qualitative think-aloud and interview data.

The study is structured in a pre-post design. Students will use the app for a week by doing mindfulness exercises from the app 7Mind and fill out questionaires before and after the week they use the mindfulness app. The hypotheses were that emotional, social, psychological and total well-being will significantly increase from pre- to post-intervention. Emotional and psychological well-being met the assumption of normality. The results of paired samples t-tests indicated significant increases for emotional well-being with a small to medium effect size, and psychological well-being, with a medium effect size. Conversely, social, and total well-being were shown to violate the assumption of normality. The results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and rank-biserial correlations revealed significant increases and large effect sizes for social, and total well-being. Findings support the potential effectiveness of the 7Mind mindfulness app in significantly enhancing dimensions of well-being in university students.

Emotion regulation (ER) strategies support affective stress recovery in daily life. However, it remains unclear whether distraction and rumination are adaptive or maladaptive strategies. Furthermore, research on the moderating role of stress intensity concerning distraction and rumination in enhancing stress recovery is limited, although it may influence the effectiveness of stress recovery. This study investigates the relationship between distraction and rumination and affective stress recovery in daily life while assessing a potential interaction with stress intensity. Methodology By using the Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM), 35 university students completed eight daily measurements on 14 days. The questionnaire assessed the use of ER strategies, negative affect (NA), positive affect (PA), and stress intensity. Linear Mixed Models (LMM) were conducted with either NA or PA as the outcome variable, and either distraction or rumination as predictors. Additional LMMs tested the interaction with stress intensity. Results Distraction was significantly associated with decreased subsequent PA (B = -4.81, SE = 2.26, t(669.44) = -2.13, p = .03, CI-9.24, -0.37), while the effects for rumination on stress recovery were non-significant. Neither distraction nor rumination was significant for NA. No interaction effect of either distraction or rumination and stress recovery was revealed. Discussion The findings indicate that distraction may increase long-term PA. The lack of significant (interaction) effects may be explained by polyregulation, defined as using multiple ER strategies for one emotional experience. This process may weaken the effectiveness of individual strategies. Future research should focus on polyregulation by investigating effective combinations and sequences of ER strategies in different contexts.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Vogtt, Mona",July 2025,English,"No.

107116,The Role of Virtual Characters in Scaffolding Inquiry-Based Learning in Genetics,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107116,"As virtual characters become more common in educational tools, it is worth exploring whether they support students’ self-reported perceived learning and satisfaction. This study investigated whether adding a simple, cartoon-style character to an online, inquiry-based genetics lesson would make a difference for secondary school students. This study took place in a real classroom setting, involving 52 students aged 11 to 13, and compared two conditions of the same lesson – one with a static virtual character and one with only pure text instruction. Students filled out surveys, and their activity in the lesson was tracked. The results showed no significant differences in students’ self-reported perceived learning and satisfaction with the genetics course. Interestingly, those who had the character version answered more questions correctly but also spent less time in the lesson overall. In the end, the character did not seem to improve outcomes in any clear way. These results suggest that adding a static virtual character is not enough to make digital learning better. For these agents to help, their design needs to be more thoughtful, especially when it comes to how they interact with students and support the learning goals. By testing this in real classrooms, the study offers some useful takeaways for educators and designers working to build better digital learning tools.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Newald, Laura M.",July 2025,English,"No.

This phenomenon is known as entrainment. This thesis introduces a new method to influence human gait, by incorporating oscillatory behaviour into the magnitude of torque pulses applied at the ankle. The central objective is to explore how dynamic pulse amplitude can affect gait entrainment and frequency locking, by using a magnitude-modulating high-level controller. The work is divided into two sections. The first section uses a sinusoidal function to vary pulse amplitude. Although frequency entrainment was not observed, insight was provided into how modulation of pulse strength could affect gait dynamics. The second section introduces an alternative design: replacing the sinusoid with a nonlinear hybrid oscillator. This results in a more adaptable system to the gait signal via a coupling term. Multiple coupling strategies were explored, including diffusive and phase difference. Simulations showed that entrainment can be achieved using diffusive coupling. These results suggest that such hybrid oscillator-based controllers are feasible for a gait entrainment device. While experiments showed no entrainment, a more robust system, as well as more participants involved in the tests, could potentially demonstrate successful frequency locking and entrainment.",Bachelor Electrical Engineering (B-EE),"Malaxa, Vlad-Carlos",June 2025,English,"No

Stimuli were presented at five exposure times (70ms-1000ms). A Bayesian generalized linear multi-level model analyzed gaze perception accuracy. Participants could detect gaze direction from manipulated images, but with significantly higher deviation than in the control condition. Gaze perception was consistently higher in the experimental condition from 140ms onwards. These results suggest humans can perceive gaze direction from the 2x2 quadrants, though with lower accuracy than from unmanipulated faces.

It proposes a theoretical framework on the “work-as-imagined” and “work-as-done” for the evaluation of functional and non-functional requirements derived from a systematic literature review. We evaluated the set of requirements through a mixed-method approach. First, a quantitative survey (Nclin = 30) assessed the perceived importance and agreement on the 62 system requirements. Second, we conducted a thematic analysis of the requirements mapped through a workshop (N = 36). Results from the survey revealed that 91.9% of requirements were both rated as important and agreed upon, demonstrating strong validation of the theoretical model.

107104,Automatic Segmentation of Individual Sensors of a Manometer in Videofluoroscopic Videos from Head and Neck Cancer Patients,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107104,"Head and neck cancer (HNC) is one of the most common type of cancers worldwide ranking as the sixth most common type of cancer in 2022 according to GLOBOCAN. HNC refers to cancers found in the oral cavity, sinonasal cavity, pharynx and larynx and the locations of these types of cancers and its treatments often result in dysphagia. The current gold standards, the videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), rely on subjective interpretation of data, often resulting in unreliable diagnosis. High-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) could provide a more quantative approach to diagnosing dysphagia but the anatomical changes in HNC patients cause abnormalities in the data making analysis using HRIM difficult. To solve this limitation, it is possible to combine HRIM with VFSS and extract the sensor locations and overlay them on the HRIM plots. Doing this manually is very time-consuming, however. In this study we aim to develop an algorithm to automatically extract the HRIM sensor locations from a VFSS video frame to aid in diagnosis of dysphagia in HNC patients.

107102,The Influences of Gradual and Late Disclosure of Evidence and Guilt and Innocence of a Suspect on Verbal Cues to Deception and Cognitive Load,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107102,"This study examines investigative interviewing of suspects looking into how to detect deception. This can be done using evidence disclosure techniques such as Tactical Use of Evidence (TUE) disclosure and Strategic Use of Evidence (SUE) disclosure. This are methods of disclosure of evidence during the interview with attempts to judge the veracity of the suspect and discriminate between guilty and innocent people. These techniques affect verbal deception cues (Statement Evidence Inconsistencies (SEI), Within Statement Inconsistencies (WSI)) and cognitive load in guilty vs. innocent suspects. Based on SUE theory, guilty suspects adopt avoidance strategies, increasing inconsistencies when evidence is strategically withheld. Tactical Use of Evidence (TUE) reveals evidence incrementally, trying to increase cognitive strain and verbal deception cues. This technique causes extra cognitive load for liars who need to readjust their strategies throughout the interview, while making things easier for truth tellers by providing retrieval cues. 
A 2-way ANOVA (N=93) tested these effects. Guilty suspects showed higher cognitive load (M = 3.11, SD = 0.69 vs. M = 2.57, SD = 0.77, p < .001), more SEI (M = 3.88, SD = 1.29 vs. M = 1.52, SD = 1.21, p < .001), and WSI (M = 1.80, SD = 1.40 vs. M = 0.34, SD = 0.65, p < .001) than innocent subjects. However, disclosure type (SUE vs. TUE) had no significant effect on cognitive load (p=.880), SEI (p=.576), or WSI (p=.169), though a marginal interaction suggested SUE may increase WSI in guilty suspects (p=.074).

While previous research has highlighted that privacy concerns influence user acceptance, existing measurement approaches are inconsistent and often fail to reflect the multidimensional nature of perceived privacy concerns. This study addresses this gap by developing and empirically testing a scale that captures users’ perceived privacy concerns across five stakeholder-related dimensions: company, government, household, third-party and cybersecurity threats. Drawing on prior frameworks and a literature-informed item development process, a survey was conducted among mostly German participants (N = 127) and analysed using exploratory factor analysis and reliability testing. Results support a four-factor model, excluding the third-party dimension due to insufficient empirical support. Additional analyses examined associations between privacy concerns, protective behaviours, gender, and device ownership. Findings revealed that household and cybersecurity concerns predicted privacy-protective behaviours, with non-owners reporting higher concern and action levels than owners, and women reporting slightly more protective behaviours than men. The findings provide an empirically tested tool for future privacy research and offer practical implications for developers and policymakers seeking to address user concerns in smart home environments.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Akchich, Sanae",July 2025,English,"No

107098,Cooling characteristics of supercritical CO2 flow in a tube subjected to extreme heat fluxes,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107098,"In this thesis, the cooling behavior of carbon dioxide in its supercritical state flowing through a
tube subjected to moderate and extreme heat fluxes is numerically investigated. The extreme
heat flux scenario is particularly relevant for nuclear fusion reactors, which experience heat
loads on the order of 10 MW/m2 during operation and up to 20 MW/m2 during shut-down
transients. Like many thermal systems, fusion reactors are currently cooled using water as a
coolant. However, given the superior thermophysical properties of supercritical CO2 (sCO2)
under certain conditions compared to water, and its chemical inertness, this thesis proposes
sCO2 as a potential alternative coolant. The study first examines the feasibility of simulating
the so-called pseudo-boiling phenomenon, where sCO2 transitions from a liquid-like to a gas-like
state under moderate heat fluxes at supercritical pressure. This is demonstrated by qualitatively
comparing simulation results with experimental and numerical data available in the literature.
Subsequently, the flow of sCO2 is simulated in a geometry specific to fusion reactors, namely a
tube with an externally mounted tungsten monoblock that is exposed to extreme heat loads of
10 MW/m2 and 20 MW/m2
. The numerical results indicate that, for similar pumping power
as water, sCO2 exhibits superior thermal performance compared to water. Specifically, the
maximum temperature of the plasma facing surface of the tungsten block is significantly lower
when sCO2 is used as the coolant. This improved performance is attributed to the high heat
transfer coefficients associated with pseudo-boiling transitions of sCO2 in the flow channel beneath
the heated monoblock, which is a mechanism absent in the case of single-phase water cooling.
By analyzing the predicted temperature, density, and velocity profiles, further physical insights
are gained into the buoyancy effects that lead to the accumulation of gas-like CO2 near the top
inner wall of the tube, which causes heat transfer deterioration for the shut-down transient of 20
MW/m2
. Recommendations are made to mitigate this effect, particularly by increasing the inlet
velocity and introducing modifications to the inner surface of the tubing.",Master Mechanical Engineering (M-ME),"Schonewille, H.",July 2025,English,"No

The analysis yielded one theme related to motivational factors for starting IF, namely health-related motivation to start IF. Two themes emerged regarding perceived benefits, which were categorized into perceived physical and perceived mental benefits. The difficulties in adherence to IF resulted in three themes which included personal barriers, external barriers and reasons for stopping IF.

South District, Ghana. It investigates how tenure systems, spatial overlaps, and local land use structures 
influence conflict dynamics. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research draws on qualitative data from 
interviews, focus group discussions, spatial data from participatory mapping, and GIS analysis. Findings 
reveal that while farming communities access land through relatively secure customary systems, pastoralists 
rely on informal, temporary arrangements with no legal recognition, leaving them highly vulnerable. Key 
conflict triggers include crop destruction by livestock, lack of designated grazing routes, and weak, often 
biased conflict resolution mechanisms.
Spatial analysis identified clear conflict hotspots, particularly where cattle routes intersect with farmland. 
Participatory mapping validated these findings and offered a platform for collective understanding of land 
use patterns. In response, the study developed a practical land use conflict resolution model. The model 
emphasizes participatory land-use planning, formal recognition of grazing rights, community-based zoning, 
and inclusive conflict resolution structures.
The research concludes that resolving land use conflict requires more than policy reform, and it demands 
local engagement, spatial clarity, and institutional collaboration. The proposed model presents a practical, 
replicable framework for managing shared land resources through a tiered conflict resolution system that 
integrates traditional mediation, formal advisory, and ADR mechanisms. It reinforces land use co-existence

Wireless monitoring can enhance postoperative care for infants by improving comfort, mobility, and parent-infant bonding. However, it remains unclear which vital signs are most important to monitor wirelessly in babies aged 0 to 2 years, and whether this varies by type of surgery. Methods:
A combination of literature review and interviews with ten pediatric healthcare professionals was used to explore which vital signs are most relevant for continuous wireless monitoring in this age group. Results:
Studies show that heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are most often measured in postoperative care and have high predictive value for early detection of complications. Wireless systems are already used in adult care, but their application in infants is still limited. The literature frequently mentions technical limitations, skin sensitivity, and lack of integration into existing hospital systems as important challenges. It also suggests that additional parameters like sleep and movement could support early warning and personalized care but are not yet standard. Interviews confirmed that heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are seen as most critical for wireless monitoring. Blood pressure and temperature remain valuable, especially in intensive settings, but may not always require continuous measurement. Discussion and conclusion:
Wireless monitoring could improve care after surgery in infants, but success depends on selecting appropriate patients and monitoring goals.

Method: This meta-analysis reviewed 160 RCTs involving 35,504 participants, retrieved from PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Studies included smartphone-based mental health apps and validated self-report anxiety measures (e.g., GAD-7). Univariable mixed-effect meta-regressions examined associations between five ACT elements cognitive defusion, values, acceptance, present-moment focus, and committed action and anxiety outcomes.

107091,Sustainable Branding and Consumer Brand Perceptions in the Automotive Industry,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107091,"Aim
This study investigates the influence of sustainability in determining customer brand perceptions
in the automobile sector. While previous research has frequently focused on single-brand cases
or electric vehicle (EV)-specific markets, this study examines the impact of sustainability on
other brand-related factors such as price, perceived quality, design, trust, and innovativeness
across multiple car brands with varying manufacturing strategies.
Methods
A quantitative survey was conducted to assess consumer impressions of four automobile brands:
two that only produce electric vehicles, and two that provide electric and internal combustion
engine versions. Prior to data collection, a brief pre-test allowed participants to identify the most
well-known and environmentally conscious automobile manufacturers. The final poll (N = 163)
included Likert-scale items that assessed characteristics such as brand image, loyalty, and major
brand assessment qualities. Each brand was evaluated using the same thematic parts, and
participants rated brands across these categories. Statistical analyses were carried out to
determine the relative impact of each aspect on brand image.
Results
Exploratory factor analysis confirmed six core dimensions—Sustainability, Design &
Innovation, Pricing, Trust & Quality, Brand Image, and Brand Loyalty—across all four brands.
In regression models predicting Brand Image, Design & Innovation (β = .33 to .63, p < .001) and
Trust & Quality (β = .33 to .55, p < .001) emerged as consistently strong predictors for all
brands. Pricing was significant for BYD (β = .41, p < .001) and Mercedes-Benz (β = .20, p <
.05), while Sustainability significantly influenced only Volvo’s Brand Image (β = .15, p < .05)
3
and Tesla’s to a marginal degree (β = .15, p < .10). For Brand Loyalty, Design & Innovation
again showed robust effects (β = .30 to .57, p < .001) alongside Trust & Quality (β = .22 to .48, p
< .001); Sustainability only significantly boosted loyalty for Volvo (β = .33, p < .001). Overall,
Mercedes-Benz led in mean brand evaluations, followed by Volvo, Tesla, and BYD.
Conlcusion
Sustainability’s role in shaping consumer brand evaluations is secondary to core attributes of
design excellence, product quality and /trustworthiness, and – depending on the brand – price.
Only Volvo’s identity as an environmentally focused manufacturer translated “green” efforts into
a stronger image and loyalty, while in other marques, sustainability had negligible or inconsistent
effects. Thus, although environmental performance remains a differentiator for certain brands,
automakers must prioritise innovative design and build consumer trust to drive brand strength

Using a between-subjects experimental design with 4 conditions, 83 participants were asked to leave comments on a fake website made to look like TikTok. Each participant was assigned to a different condition, which changed what type of comments they saw next to the videos. Comments could either be positive or negative, and they can be left by perceived anonymous users or very identifiable users. The comments left by participants were coded on their levels of Profanity, Hostility, Inappropriateness and Community Guideline Violations. The results show that negative commenting environments show higher levels of norm-breaking behaviour, regardless of the level of perceived anonymity. A post-experiment survey also shows that most people dislike profanity and violations, but are alright with sarcasm and insensitive behaviour.

107086,The Impact of Packaging : How Color Saturation and Imagery Affect Purchase Intentions and Perceptions of Plant-Based Meat,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107086,"As plant-based diets become increasingly popular, understanding how packaging design influences consumers’ perceptions and purchase intentions is essential. Although previous research indicates that packaging affects consumers’ purchase decisions and product perceptions, these effects remain underexplored in the context of plant-based meat. This knowledge is vital because some consumers still view plant-based meat as unhealthy and unappetizing. Overcoming these barriers could promote healthier, more sustainable food choices. This study examined how color saturation and front-of-pack imagery, affect perceptions of healthiness, tastiness, purchase intent, and brand image of plant-based meat. A 2 (color saturation: high vs. low) by 2 (imagery type: realistic image of a prepared meal vs. plant symbol) between-subjects design was used with 199 participants. Results showed that while color saturation did not significantly influence any of the outcomes, realistic imagery of a prepared meal significantly impacted perceived healthiness and tastiness. These findings suggest that realistic food imagery may be more effective in shaping consumer perceptions of plant-based meat. Therefore, marketers seeking to enhance the appeal of plant-based meat should consider using realistic images of prepared meals. Future research should address limitations such as static online images, using only one product, a homogeneous sample, and the lack of realistic consumption settings.",Bachelor Communication Science (B-COM),"Gordon, Dana",June 2025,English,"No

The Full Range Leadership Theory was used to examine the effects of transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership styles on job satisfaction. Perceived work pressure and motivation were shown to be mediating variables. A quantitative survey of 121 frontline sales staff members was used to gather data. According to the findings, transformational leadership has a favorable impact on job satisfaction both directly and indirectly by boosting motivation and lowering stress levels. Despite increased perceived work pressure, transactional leadership also has a positive, albeit lesser, benefit that is mostly motivated. Surprisingly, there is a positive direct correlation between laissez-faire leadership and satisfaction; however, this impact is completely countered by increased job pressure and decreased motivation.By combining several leadership philosophies and psychological mediators into a single, complete model, the study advances leadership research and highlights the significance of leadership awareness in high-pressure sales environments.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Kumarasamy, A.",June 2025,English,"No.

perceive website tutorials differently from students from Germanic cultures, addressing the
lack of comparative research on cultural differences in the user experience of digital
instructions. Background and Relevance: By utilizing Hofstede’s cultural dimension of
Uncertainty Avoidance (UA), the study investigates the extent of how cultural backgrounds
influence users’ expectations and perception of website tutorials when performing simple
tasks on a demo website, adding to the limited literature comparing Latin American and
Germanic perspectives in a user experience (UX) context. Research Question: The research
question this study aims to answer is to what extent do Latin American students perceive
tutorials differently to Germanic students? Methods: A qualitative design was used with
sixteen university students, eight of each cultural group, who completed a controlled task on a
demo blog-post website (“MyLore”) using either a short (Tutorial A) or long (Tutorial B)
tutorial. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, thematically analysed, and coded to
compare perceptions of usefulness, efficiency, trust, and overall attitude towards tutorials.
Discussion: The analysis from the interviews confirm that cultural background of users can
affect their user experience and their perception of website tutorials as explored by previous
research Latin American participants displayed a stronger preference for structured guidance
and a positive perception towards both tutorials, while Germanic participants share the
preference of not needing a tutorial. This expands on the previously lacking literature that
compares the cultures of Latin America and Germanic countries. Conclusion: This study
demonstrates that cultural background, when analysed with the Hofstede dimension of
Uncertainty Avoidance, influences students’ perceptions of website tutorials. Websites should
consider adapting tutorial formats that better fit the server region in which they are accessed,
ensuring instructions accommodate users’ expectations given their cultural background.",Bachelor Communication Science (B-COM),"Serednicki, Isabela",June 2025,English,"No.

This study addresses this gap by exploring how Moldovans use clothes to express identity, navigate materialism, manage impressions, and respond to social influences, comparing Moldovans in Moldova (n=13) and the Netherlands (n=17). 
Data were collected through 30 individual interviews. Thematic analysis helped explore how cultural norms, social expectations, and identity expression shape clothing choices, highlighting similarities and differences between the two groups. 
Participants in both groups use clothes to express intelligence, seriousness, and uniqueness. Moldovans in Moldova tie clothing more to social status, while those in the Netherlands value Moldovan folk costumes more. Materialism, tied to emotional needs and ease of buying, is less pronounced in the Netherlands. Gender norms, social media, and fear of judgment influence both groups, with diaspora participants being more aware of these pressures. Common cultural drivers include tidiness and post-Soviet influence; psychological ones involve seeking validation and fearing criticism.

With approximately 80% of Ghana's land held under customary tenure, traditional authorities play a pivotal role in land governance. Yet challenges such as tenure insecurity, multiple land sales, and the absence of formal documentation persist. Through a qualitative research approach involving semi-structured interviews with traditional authorities, land buyers, community members, and institutional actors, as well as spatial analysis to identify areas with multiple land sale problems. The study explores how customary land practices influence land access, transaction processes, and tenure security in the ILM. Findings reveal that while CLA enhances accessibility and affordability in land acquisition, its limited integration with formal systems results in inefficiencies, tenure insecurity, multiple land sales and disputes. The research highlights the role of oral agreements, symbolic rituals, document agreements and customary validation in legitimizing transactions, but also identifies gaps in record-keeping and transparency. The study proposes a transaction verification framework to align customary and formal land administration systems, aiming to enhance transparency, improve land tenure security, and foster a more efficient and equitable land market. These insights contribute to ongoing policy efforts to harmonize Ghana’s dual land governance systems and support sustainable land management.

Drawing on the Elaboration Likelihood Model and schema congruity theory, it employs a mixed-methods design comprising a pre-post experimental survey (N = 93) and semi-structured interviews (N = 8). Results reveal that McDonald’s humour advertisement significantly reduced perceptions across all four brand dimensions (e.g. authenticity declined by M = -1.50, p < .001), suggesting humour can undermine brand equity when perceived as superficial. In contrast, Burger King’s disgust-based advertisement produced only modest declines, with trust and competence remaining statistically stable. Qualitative findings indicate that disgust may signal authenticity if congruent with brand identity, while humour risks triviality. The study highlights that emotional appeals must align with brand values and audience expectations to avoid reputational harm.

107079,How are women working in motorsport framed in online news coverage and media compared with men?,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107079,"Aim:
This study explores how women working in motorsport are framed in online media and news 
coverage compared to their male counterparts. While female visibility in motorsport has 
increased, questions remain about whether media portrayals reflect true inclusion or reinforce 
gendered stereotypes. 
Methods:
A qualitative content analysis was conducted on 80 media items, including 50 news articles 
and 30 social media posts from LinkedIn and Instagram. Using a deductively developed 
codebook based on social role theory and role congruity theory, the analysis focused on 
identifying patterns in framing, narrative structures, and language use across gender lines.
Results:
The findings reveal consistent gendered differences in media representation. Women were 
frequently positioned as exceptions rather than normalized professionals. In contrast, men 
were overwhelmingly associated with performance-based language and normalized authority, 
often without reference to their gender. Also, women were subject to questioning of 
legitimacy and double standards, which were absent from male-focused content. Ultimately, 
social media platforms showed more progressive and competence-based portrayals compared 
to traditional news outlets.
Conclusion: 
Despite growing female participation and diversity efforts in motorsport, media coverage 
continues to frame women through symbolic or gendered lenses. This reinforces structural 
inequalities and legitimacy in the sport. To achieve true inclusion, both media practitioners and motorsport organizations must shift toward competence-driven narratives and institutional 
change that transform gendered expectations.",Bachelor Communication Science (B-COM),"Manfré, Chiara",June 2025,English,"No.

terms of plastic pollution? Plastic pollution campaigns often default to powerful imagery, 
however, little evidence specifies whether the visual or textual presentation format of an 
advertisement is more effective in communicating environmental issues, specifically 
plastic pollution. This study aims to explore to which visual imagery, compared with text
only billboard testimonials, enhances recall of advertisements on plastic pollution. 
Employing a mixed-methods approach, this study combines a qualitative preliminary 
study and a quantitative online experiment. The qualitative data were collected through 5 
lay participants, narrating a Greenpeace campaign picture into a word testimonial that 
preserved salient visuals and served as the text stimulus. The quantitative data was 
gathered through an online experiment where participants were randomly assigned to 
either the text or the image stimuli condition. In sum, 58 participants imagined a five
minute bus-shelter wait before viewing one stimulus and completing pre/post measures of 
environmental concern, attitude towards the advertisement, and recall. The analyses 
revealed no significant group differences in environmental concern, attitude towards the 
advertisement, and recall. Accordingly, there was even a decline in environmental concern 
in both groups. This study has limitations due to its small sample size as well as the 
quantitative online design, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Future

Specifically, it addressed three research questions: (1) How does wearing a smartwatch affect retrospective perceptions of stress? (2) Does it impact health anxiety levels? (3) How does it influence perceived stress in daily life? The study was a two-week within-subject design with 70 participants. They wore a wearable during one of the two weeks, depending on the group allocation. Participants filled out retrospective questionnaires, the ones relevant for this study are the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI).

Wellness content, ranging from fitness to mental health, have become increasingly widespread, with the industry reaching 2$ trillion dollars. While self-improvement is inherently positive, social media has allowed for the rapid and unregulated spread of wellness-related content, creating risks of health misinformation, commercialisation, and shaping of unrealistic expectations. Gen-Z users in particular show high engagement rates with wellness content, making them the centre focus of this study. Aim: This study dives into how Gen Z makes sense of, and emotionally engages with, wellness content on social media, as well as what drives their engagement. Methods: A qualitative, exploratory design were used, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 Gen Z users aged 20 to 25, and the data underwent thematic analysis informed by the theoretical background of the study. Results: The research reveals that Gen Z users feel inspired and motivated, particularly in fitness and health, but they also experience pressure, fatigue, and self-comparison. The drivers of engagement also vary, including visual appeal, community, and a yearning for personal growth. Conclusion: Wellness content on social media acts not only as an informational resource but also as a venue for building identity and living aspirational lives, which introduces risks of dependency or emotional harm.

temporal resolution. Specifically, this occurs in MRI, where rapid anatomical motion
and physiological changes demand high temporal fidelity, creating a trade-off between
high spatial and temporal fidelity. An emerging direction in accelerated MRI reconstruction is the integration of deep learning techniques. Compared to more iterative
methods like compressed sensing, deep learning methods offer improved reconstruction
quality and also enable the possibility of real-time imaging. From the deep learning
architectures, unsupervised learning strategies using neural networks have been proposed, as they do not require large datasets. Among these approaches, implicit neural
representations (INRs) offer a strong framework by modeling data as continuous functions that map spatial and temporal coordinates to signal values. However, most
existing approaches rely on positional encoding of the input coordinates, latent motion codes, and deformation networks to enhance temporal consistency in the presence
of spatial undersampling. In this work, we incorporate an Optimal Transport-based
regularization strategy into an implicit neural representation (INR) framework to enable higher spatiotemporal undersampling for physically plausible transitions between
frames. Specifically, we incorporate temporal prior into the model through optimal
transport (OT) regularization. We introduce two types of regularization: one based on
the Wasserstein distance between consecutive frames and another based on a barycenter formulation. We demonstrate that both regularizers promote temporally coherent reconstructions and improve performance under high spatiotemporal subsampling

The study used a qualitative approach, which evaluates four notification prototypes through semi-structured interviews with 16 participants. Each prototype represented a different combination of content and visual design.
The results showed that the practical content was the main driver of perceived usefulness; while visual richness could enhance or diminish user engagement, and it depends on its consistency with the text. Emojis were welcomed when they promoted emotional clarity or appeal but were often viewed as manipulative or distracting when matched with ambiguous content. Additionally, participants expressed different preferences depending on the context: during work, they preferred concise, simplified notifications; while during leisure, they are more tolerant to expressive and visually rich formats.

107063,How Individuals with No Prior Experience Evaluate Time-Restricted Eating (TRE) Through the Lens of the Health Belief Model,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107063,"Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a dietary approach associated with health benefits such as reduced glucose levels and improved sleep by limiting daily food intake to a specific time window. While research has often focused on individuals who have practiced TRE, little is known about the perceptions of those without prior experience. This study explores how individuals with no experience of TRE perceive its potential benefits, barriers, health risks, and their ability to adopt it.
A qualitative approach was used, involving semi-structured interviews with ten participants (6 females, 4 males; ages 20–45; M = 26.7). The Health Belief Model (HBM) served as a conceptual framework for the interview guide and the subsequent thematic analysis. Participants anticipated both health and behavioural benefits, such as improved metabolism and a more structured routine. Commonly mentioned barriers included hunger, low energy, and social situations. Self-efficacy was often tied to social support. Health risks, though mentioned less frequently, included fatigue and nutritional concerns.
The findings show that individuals without prior TRE experience already form detailed expectations shaped by personal, social, and environmental factors. Recognising these pre-adoption beliefs is essential for designing tailored health communication and support strategies that address both benefits and concerns.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Müller, Danica",July 2025,English,"No

107062,Comparative Framing and Sentiment Analysis of Trump’s 2nd of April Tariff Announcement,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107062,"This research investigates how U.S. media outlets with different ideologies framed President Donald J. Trump’s tariffs on April 2, 2025, and how the public responded to this policy. This media analysis contains a qualitative framing analysis of 30 news articles, ten per media outlet, varying from left-leaning (The New York Times), center-leaning (The Hill), and right-leaning outlets (Deseret News). These articles were coded by Entman's framing functions and Semetko & Valkenburg's generic frames. The findings indicate that media outlets framed the event in distinct ways aligned with their beliefs. Left outlets framed tariffs as an economic risk and moral criticism, centrist outlets focused on facts and uncertainty, while right-leaning outlets framed tariffs as a justified response against fair trade. All outlets did acknowledge the uncertainty and fast decisions of Trump. After the framing analysis, a lexicon-based quantitative sentiment analysis was executed, focusing on 7,000 comments on YouTube covering the announcement live. This showed a near-perfect polarity (473 positive vs. 450 negative). The sentiment analysis of YouTube videos indicated a polarized picture of positive and negative public reactions, with emotions such as trust, anticipation, anger, and fear being most present. Together, results highlight that partisan media frames quickly influence the feelings people express online, and those reactions in turn reinforce the news narratives.

Methods: A quantitative survey study (N = 91) was sent out to parents from different countries with children who have at some point in time been in standardized education. The survey measured three independent variables: AI literacy, ethical concerns about AI, and stigma towards AI. The research aimed to discover how these three independent variables influenced the levels of support held by parents towards AI education courses; the dependent fourth variable measured. 
Results: The results of this study showed that each independent variable had significant evidence of a correlation to levels of support, with stigma being the most influential. A moderation analysis showed that AI literacy did not impact the individual relationships of ethical concerns and stigma on levels of support. 
Conclusions: Should school systems wish to include AI education in their program, they should influence parents to associate positive attitudes with the innovation.

107059,Exploring the Effect of Environmental Interaction on Belief Change Towards Climate Change : A Virtual Reality Approach,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107059,"Climate change is a major global threat, with estimates predicting up to 14.5 million additional deaths by 2050. Misinformation about it contributes to confusion, and political inaction. Virtual reality (VR), with its immersive and interactive qualities, has shown promise as a tool for misinformation correction. Building on the study by Erisen et al. (2024), which found that VR can increase belief in climate change and reduce skepticism, the present study explores whether user engagement and avatar presence further enhance these effects. A mixed quasi-experimental longitudinal design was used, with data collected at four time points across three conditions: a VR condition with a text-based correction, a VR condition featuring a human avatar delivering the correction, and a social media condition used as control. The final sample consisted of 87 participants. Measures included items on climate change belief and skepticism assessed via surveys, and user engagement measured through the number of teleportations in the VR environment. No significant effects were found for teleportation frequency or avatar presence on belief or skepticism. These findings align with previous research and suggest that simple forms of interaction, such as teleportation and avatars, may not suffice to enhance the effectiveness of VR-based misinformation correction.

107058,Managers’ and employees’perception of diversity and inclusion in the high-tech sector : A qualitative investigation,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107058,"This thesis explores how Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) practices are perceived to influence job flourishing among employees and managers in a Dutch high-tech manufacturing organization. Drawing on Social Identity Theory (SIT) and the Input–Process–Output (IPO) framework, this study investigates how identity-based characteristics influence individual-level perceptions and experiences of inclusion. The findings reveal that perceptions of inclusion differ substantially between dominant group members, in this context, the Dutch male participants, and those identifying with minority groups. While dominant group members perceive the organizational culture as inclusive, individuals who do not identify with the dominant group perceive barriers to recognition, opportunities, and belonging. In contrast to assumptions in existing literature, hierarchical status did not appear to influence D&I perceptions as strongly as identity-based factors, particularly gender. The findings indicate that D&I outcomes are primarily shaped by informal processes and interpersonal interactions, rather than formal policies. The data structure, developed using the Gioia methodology, highlights how limited organizational support and a general resistance to D&I, particularly among the Management Team, limit inclusion and restrict job flourishing for the minority groups. These insights emphasize the need for high-tech organizations to move beyond surface-level representation and install meaningful inclusion practices aimed at creating equal opportunities for individuals to flourish.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Jansen, S.",June 2025,English,"No.

107057,Enhancing Cultural Heritage Engagement through Eye Gaze Locomotion in Virtual Reality,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107057,"Cultural heritage institutions are increasingly seeking ways to make their collections
accessible and engaging for younger audiences. This research investigates how eye
gaze-based locomotion methods might improve usability and presence in Immersive
Virtual Reality (Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR)) exhibitions, using the HERE: Black
in Rembrandt’s Time exhibition as a case study. The exhibition presents Black individuals as central figures in 17th-century Dutch art, offering narratives about representation and diversity that could potentially resonate with adolescent visitors.
Preliminary studies with adolescents revealed significant challenges with traditional controller-based navigation in IVR. The participants struggled to understand
the controls and became distracted by the technology itself rather than engaging
with the exhibition content. These observations suggested that navigation barriers needed to be addressed before meaningful engagement with cultural narratives
could occur.
This research examines whether eye gaze-based locomotion methods could provide more intuitive navigation, potentially allowing users to focus on exhibition content rather than interface mechanics. Two methods were developed and compared:
direct eye gaze teleportation, where users instantly moved to locations they looked
at, and eye gaze portal-based locomotion, where gazing at paintings generated portals that users physically walked through.
A within-subjects study with 29 participants (mainly university students aged 18-
28) evaluated both methods using physical movement tracking, presence questionnaires (IGroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ)), System Usability Scale (System Usability Scale (SUS)), and qualitative feedback. The eye gaze portal method was
associated with more physical movement and higher spatial presence scores, while
the teleportation method received slightly higher usability ratings.
In particular, participants using either eye gaze method spent considerably more
time viewing artworks compared to data from previous studies using controller-based navigation (approximately 109-116 seconds versus 28 seconds in the first
three minutes). Although this comparison involves different groups of participants
and conditions, the magnitude of the difference suggests that removing distractions
related to the controller may facilitate greater attention to the exhibition content. The research also documented how participants maintained conventional museum behaviors in the virtual environment, standing at traditional viewing distances
despite the freedom provided by virtual reality. This persistence of familiar behavioral patterns indicates that users apply existing mental frameworks even in novel
technological contexts.
Both locomotion methods demonstrated acceptable usability levels, though neither proved universally superior. The optimal choice appears to depend on specific
exhibition goals and user preferences. These findings establish the foundations for
future research investigating whether improved navigation usability translates to increased appreciation of the diversity narratives presented in cultural heritage exhibitions. Although this study focused on the fundamental challenge of intuitive navigation, it represents the necessary foundation for examining more complex educational
and cultural outcomes in subsequent research with adolescents.",Master Interaction Technology (M-ITECH),"Pops, Henrico",June 2025,English,"No

While the PVQ-RR captures general human values, it does not account for privacy-related values. Drawing on Burgoon’s (1982) theory and prior research by Russa (2024) and Markink (2024), this study focuses specifically on conceptualising and measuring social privacy, which is defined as the desire to manage one’s interpersonal boundaries and social interactions. Six newly developed social value items and six behavioural items were tested using a multi-country sample from Germany (N = 61), France (N = 28), and Spain (N = 20). Exploratory factor analysis revealed that only three of the six value items showed acceptable loadings, and of those, just one loaded strongly on the social privacy factor. This suggests that the construct is not yet well-measured, a challenge also observed in earlier studies. Nevertheless, social privacy values significantly predicted several privacy-related behaviours across countries, supporting the scale’s predictive validity. The findings suggest that while social privacy is a theoretically meaningful dimension, further refinement of its measurement is needed.

This study investigates how fans and artists justify their support for or opposition to posthumous releases, considering the tension between cultural and economic values. Mac Miller serves as a case study, with his posthumous releases widely seen as respectfully managed. Using a qualitative design with semi-structured interviews, 16 participants (artists and fans) shared their views on posthumous music. An abductive thematic approach was used to analyse the data. Fans and artists voiced shared concerns about exploitation in posthumous music, especially when commercial motives overshadow respect for an artist’s legacy. While fans were more critical of profit-driven releases, artists saw commercial structures as necessary to preserve and share their work. AI technologies intensified fears of exploitation due to the loss of human creativity and control. Clear consent mechanisms—like musical wills—were viewed as important ways to protect artists’ autonomy and ensure releases remain meaningful tributes. Overall, posthumous releases involve balancing cultural and economic values. Ethical approaches balance profit with respect for an artist’s legacy through transparency, musical wills, and clear agreements about AI use. These strategies help ensure these releases remain genuine tributes that honour, rather than exploit, the artist’s legacy.",Bachelor Communication Science (B-COM),"Waenink, Janneke",June 2025,English,"No

107044,Perceptions of the anticipated adoption of a wearable troponin monitoring device among healthcare experts and at-risk individuals,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107044,"As wearable health technologies advance, the possibility of continuously monitoring cardiac biomarkers like troponin becomes a growing possibility. This qualitative study explores the anticipated adoption of a wearable troponin-monitoring device by two potential user groups: at-risk individuals and healthcare professionals. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted, including ten at-risk individuals and five healthcare professionals.
The findings were analysed through the lens of the four theoretical models: the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), the Health Belief Model (HBM), and the Uses and Gratifications Theory (UGT). These models explore how both groups assess the requirements and expectations towards the device, and their motivations.
The results show that participants value comfort, aesthetics, and minimal disruption to daily life, particularly among at-risk individuals. Regulatory approvals, clinical validation, and endorsement by healthcare professionals are also important factors for the adoption. While patients valued peace of mind and preventive monitoring, professionals raised concerns about overdiagnosis and system burden. Both groups emphasised the need for clear protocols, data sharing, and reimbursement structures to support real-world implementation. Cultural context also shaped expectations, with noticeable contrasts between participants from Western and Eastern Europe.
This study shows that the adoption of a troponin wearable device depends not only on technical features, but its fit within users’ routines, healthcare infrastructure, and cultural norms. The results suggest that existing technology adoption models alone are insufficient to explain user behaviour in medical contexts, it is important to combine models from both technology and health behaviour domains. This study shows that successful adoption of wearable troponin-monitoring technology depends not only on its technical capabilities, but also on its fit within users’ daily lives and existing healthcare systems.

Although financial motives of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are well documented, people-related factors remain a major source for performance shortcomings. This study analyzes (1) how employees experience and make sense of structural change following an acquisition and (2) how these experiences shape their reactions to the changes made during the integration. It draws on the concepts of sensemaking and sensegiving, social and organizational identity, and organizational culture and analyzes how these concepts interact to shape employees’ experiences and responses.
A qualitative, multiple-case design was applied. 18 semi-structured interviews were conducted with current and former entry-level employees, middle managers, and executives of 10 software SMEs that were acquired between 2021 and 2024. By analyzing and interpreting the data iteratively in an abductive approach, three reoccurring patterns emerged. First, implausible or absent sensegiving attempts led to stressful sensemaking processes, filled by negative anticipations and uncertainty. Second, employees were seen as replaceable by cost-focused acquirers, leading to knowledge drain and identity deconstruction. Third, vastly distinctive organizational cultures clashed with each other, leading to gradual disengagement and exit. The outcomes call for cultural preservation of the acquired company during post-merger integration to keep employees in knowledge-intensive working environments. Further, this research highlights the importance of thorough planning and creating a strong sensegiving narrative to avoid stressful disruptions during integration.",Bachelor Communication Science (B-COM),"Werche, J.",June 2025,English,"No

This is known as speciesism, the differential treatment of animals solely based on their membership in a certain species. As speciesism causes a myriad of welfare problems, a change is needed in the way we regard animals. This study investigated whether imagining intergroup contact (IIC) could reduce speciesism through the mediator social dominance orientation (SDO), the desire to achieve and maintain group-based dominance. Additionally, the potential mediating role of empathy in the relationship between IIC and SDO was explored. This study had an experimental between-participants design. The participants were divided into a contact condition who imagined contact with a cow and a control condition who had a neutral task of imagining a frequently visited building. Participants’ SDO was measured pre- and post-contact, and speciesist attitudes, behavioural intentions, and empathy were measured post-contact. The study showed that there was no effect of IIC on speciesism, therefore, SDO could not mediate the relationship. Participants in the contact condition had a higher SDO score after contact than before. Empathy did not mediate the relationship between IIC and SDO.

Participants were randomly assigned to one of the conditions and had to view a manipulated video. A questionnaire was used to measure trust and prior knowledge. The results showed that neither perceived authority nor use of jargon significantly influenced trust in the video. However, prior knowledge emerged as a significantly strong predictor of trust. No significant interaction effects were found between prior knowledge and the manipulated variables, suggesting that prior knowledge did not moderate the influence of authority or jargon. The findings show that authority and jargon may not be as effective in evaluating trust in TikTok’s short-video format, but prior knowledge is.

This thesis addresses the following research question: How can a data-driven model be developed to support StockWatch in systematically finding outperforming stocks? To answer this, a Machine Learning model was developed, using 19 stock-specific and 5 macroeconomic characteristics. This process started with an OLS model, which was subsequently enhanced by two Machine Learning models (Random Forest and Neural Networks). The best performing model was an ensemble model using an equal weighting between Random Forest and Neural Networks. This model’s decile 1 portfolio achieved a Sharpe ratio of 0.94 on an out-of-sample test, delivering more than 50% excess returns per unit of volatility, and produced 22.61% excess returns per year. A screening tool was built to practically implement this model for StockWatch and help users find outperforming stocks from the S&P 500, AEX, and EURO STOXX 50 Index. This thesis recommends launching a Big Data portfolio based on this model to provide additional value to StockWatch’s subscribers.",Bachelor Industrial Engineering & Management Science (B-IEM),"Mink, R.J. de",June 2025,English,"No

107034,Empathy or Outrage? : Framing and Tone in Abortion Discourse on X During the 2024 Election,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107034,"Social media has transformed how political messages are crafted, facilitated, and disseminated to the public. Recent research has shifted focus to how new media can influence public opinion, specifically in environments of high polarisation such as the United States. Following the ‘Dobbs
v. Jackson’s ruling, abortion policy on X (formerly Twitter) has shifted into an emotionally charged battleground, offering a unique opportunity to explore how political actors use rhetorical strategies. This thesis investigates how presidential candidates, affiliated organisations, and political influencers use frames and tones in their tweets regarding abortion during the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Using a qualitative content analysis of 999 tweets (n = 333 per actor type), and a codebook across nine frames and eight tones developed through deductive and inductive methods. The findings reveal that frame and tone choices systematically align with actor identity and their communicative goals. Moreover, sentiment analysis and chi-square testing validate that these rhetorical strategies are not randomly applied but systematically applied. The findings reveal that frame and tone choices systematically align with actor identity and communicative goals. Additional sentiment analysis and chi-square testing confirmed that these rhetorical strategies are not randomly applied but strategically constructed. Ultimately, this thesis contributes to the growing framework of framing (Entman, 1993), tone (Pipal et al., 2024), and

107033,You Can Stop Crime! : Understanding The Impact Of Guardianship On Crime,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/107033,"This study will explore the effect of dynamic guardianship to ensure public and residential safety. Through exploration of dynamic guardianship, effective strategies can be discovered to enhance residential security and minimise the risk of burglary. This form of guardianship integrates physical, symbolic and dynamic guardianship elements to give the feeling of physical presence at the location, when occupation is not present. These dynamic guardianship elements could be cameras attached to the house, self-closing curtains, or lights being on inside the residency. By testing for these multiple elements, one can learn more about the scouting of burglars, for example, considering conscious and unconscious decision making. Furthermore, one can also understand residential concerns better. Therefore, this study will put participants in the role of a pretend burglar and/or in the position of a resident, by using pre-recorded clips in video form. The video environment will show the participants a certain amount of conditions regarding the physical and symbolic guardianship elements, which will be allocated randomly. All video clips will be presented in daylight.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Donovan, Elliot",June 2025,English,"No

A 2 (minimalistic vs. non-minimalistic design) x 2 (utilitarian vs. hedonic product) between-subjects experiment (N = 172) was conducted to assess brand attitude, product attitude, purchase intention, perceived quality, and product purity. Results showed that non-minimalistic designs led to more favorable brand and product attitudes and higher perceived quality. An exploratory analysis of the interaction effect between product type and package design revealed that minimalistic designs decreased perceived quality for hedonic products but had no effect on utilitarian ones. Consumer familiarity with minimalism was added as an exploratory covariate and positively influenced product attitude. These findings suggest that while minimalistic design may align with modern branding aesthetics, it does not universally enhance consumer perceptions. This suggests that product package design is not a one-size-fits-all strategy, and designs may need to be tailored to product type and audience familiarity with minimalistic packaging.",Bachelor Communication Science (B-COM),"Weytingh, I.F.",July 2025,English,"No.

A total of 33 students (Mage = 21.67) participated in an Experience Sampling Method (ESM) study, completing three daily questionnaires over 15 days. Linear mixed-effects models revealed a positive within-person association between social interaction frequency and momentary mood (b = .021, p = .038) and between perceived social connectedness and momentary mood (b = .65, p < .001).  Perceived social connectedness had a significantly stronger within-person association with momentary mood than social interaction frequency (b = - .42, p < .001).  As expected, the quality of social interactions appears more important for momentary mood enhancement than their quantity. The results suggest that perceived social connectedness considerably shapes students’ momentary mood. Future research should further investigate the identified associations, for instance, by conducting time-lagged or between-person analyses. Universities are recommended to enhance their students’ momentary mood through social events promoting social connectedness.

often fail to provide long-term, meaningful solutions, innovative and accessible interventions are needed. This study examined the effectiveness of a values-based online intervention, with and without visual support, in enhancing psychological well-being among Dutch university students. The study assessed the intervention impact on valued living, psychological flexibility, and adaptability, and whether flexibility mediates the relationship between valued living and adaptability. It was hypothesised that participants in the intervention conditions would show greater improvements in all outcomes compared to the control group, with flexibility potentially mediating the relationship between valued living and adaptability.
Methods: A randomised, three-group, pre-post-design (n = 97) was utilised to evaluate a 9-day online values-based intervention. Results: A significant improvement in valued living was found (p =.03), but no significant effects were found for flexibility (p =.40), adaptability (p =.27), or the mediation role of flexibility (p =.25). Discussion: The findings suggest that while values clarification can positively impact valued living, it may not be sufficient to influence broader psychological constructs without integrating additional Acceptance Commitment Therapy components. Future research should investigate alternative mechanisms such as those proposed by Self-Determination Theory, which indicate that increases in autonomy and intrinsic motivation, rather than flexibility or adaptability, might explain the observed non-significant results. Thus, it is essential to further explore which processes best support broader psychological outcomes.

The uncritical reliance on inaccurate robotic cues could override human judgment, potentially causing serious errors, for example, administering the wrong medication based on the robot’s misleading gestures or mishandling hazardous materials in a factory. This work investigated how the reliability of a robot's referential gaze, in tasks of varying complexity, affects human-robot interaction. A self-constructed gaze control system for a screen-based robot was incorporated within a classification game, where participants received attentional gaze cues from the robots. These referential cues differed per robot in their reliability, leading to a high-validity robot, a low-validity robot, and a third neutral robot, which did not execute any referential gaze. Findings indicate that the existence of referential gaze, reliable or not, leads to significantly higher gaze predictability and faster decision-making as participants develop their own interaction strategies. We found that participants manifested a strong cognitive bias to trust and follow the gaze of the high-validity robot, which was similarly preferred in subjective ratings of anthropomorphism, likability, and intelligence.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Kruse, Devin",July 2025,English,"No

This study investigates how fitness-focused TikTok trends, specifically #fitspiration and #WhatIEatInADay, affect body image, exercise behavior, and nutrition habits in individuals aged 18 to 25. A quantitative online survey (N = 164) was conducted to examine how these effects are shaped by perceived social norms, personality traits, and gender. Regression and moderation analyses revealed that exposure to fitness content did not significantly influence body image. Instead, having a positive body image was found to significantly and positively predict exercise behavior. Furthermore, the relationship between body image and nutrition behavior was moderated by perceived social norms, suggesting that societal expectations strongly shape dietary choices. No significant moderating effects were found for gender or personality traits, and perceived social norms were not directly influenced by content exposure. These findings indicate that fitness-related TikTok content may reinforce preexisting body ideals rather than directly altering self-perception or behavior. Future research should consider longitudinal approaches or implicit association measures to better understand perceived social norms.

Participants then evaluated the logos in terms of security values, hedonic values and industry recognition of the brand sector (food or finance). The study partially showed a relationship between colour temperature and customers' perception. Warm colours, even for companies in the financial industry, increase the perceived friendliness and openness of the brand.

In this paper, two hexapod leg designs with minimized hysteresis are presented. The research is used to determine a suitable design direction for a next-generation hybrid testing setup for offshore floating windturbines. Two actuator layouts are considered: an arc-based design including flexures, and a linear design utilizing air bearings. To address the dominant contribution of moving power cables induced hysteresis, cables are partially replaced with deterministic compliant elements. A two-linkage cable guide is developed and moving-coil configurations are implemented. This enables the use of ironless core actuators, which result in low hysteresis and cogging-free operation, while still meeting the tight requirements on the moving mass, actuation forces, and hysteresis. Experimental validation shows a maximum hysteresis of 0.0083 Nm for the arc design and 0.037 N for the linear design, corresponding to 0.0233% and 0.0319% of their respective continuous torque or force ratings. Compared to a hexapod with iron core actuators (the T-Flex), the arc and linear designs reduce the hysteresis to 3.4% and 4.7%, respectively. With this achievement, the performancelimitations byhysteresis are effectively eliminated, as the hysteresis will no longer be the critical factor in the current designs.

In this situation, bioplastic has gained public attention as it has similar characteristics to plastic and is degradable. However, promoting bioplastic packages is facing challenges as individuals cannot distinguish them from traditional plastic due to these materials being too similar in visual and haptic aspects. To address this gap, this research explored how visual cues can influence customers' perception of products' sustainability, green trust and willingness to pay by presenting green visual elements and eco-labels on the packaging. We employed a 2 (Green visual elements: with/without) × 2 (Eco-label: with/without) between-subjects experimental design, randomly assigning participants to one of four conditions. The results showed that while green visual elements and eco-labels individually strengthened participants' perceived sustainability, thereby indirectly increasing their purchase intention and green trust, their interaction effect was not significant. Specifically, no additive effect was observed when both green visual elements and eco-labels appeared together. These findings support the concept that visual cues can effectively influence consumer behavior through symbolic association.

However, they suffer from high dropout rates. While dropout has been investigated, a gap in the literature is present in the relationship between the severity of anxiety, depression, sleep quality and the moment of dropout. Thus, this study aimed to explore the relationship between these variables by analyzing the data from three independent Digital Mental Health Interventions. The final sample comprised 110 participants. To analyze the relationship between the severity of anxiety, depression, sleep quality and the moment of dropout, survival analysis was used. Kaplan-Meier estimates were computed, and log-rank tests were conducted, comparing groups of differing severities of the independent variables. The log-rank tests did not show significant results.

Traditionally, patients have often been excluded from key stages of research such as design and planning, creating a gap between research outcomes and patient needs. Although awareness of involving patients is growing, this practice remains underused and its benefits are not always recognized by researchers. The study aims to understand how patient participation can improve the research process and create meaningful impact for both research and patients. Semi-structured interviews with six patients revealed that they value equal collaboration, respect, clear communication, and regular feedback throughout the research process. Patients reported benefits such as increased knowledge about their illness, insight into scientific research, and personal growth, including development of skills and confidence. Many expressed that contributing their experience led to a sense of purpose and satisfaction in helping improve care for other patients. However, participants noted that when feedback on their contributions was lacking, it reduced their feeling of impact.

Research relates justice preferences to an interplay of contextual factors, such as perceived seriousness and the choice of justice options, and individuals’ characteristics, including moral foundations and worldviews. This study employs a within-subjects design to examine public perception of justice approaches across six crime case vignettes of varying severity and explore the role of moral foundations and worldviews in justice preferences. Participants (N = 82) chose among three justice approaches: (1) a purely retributive sentencing process, (2) a restorative procedure with impact on sentencing, or (3) a parallel restorative procedure without impact on sentencing and rated the perceived appropriateness of each justice option across all cases. In line with the hypotheses, as perceived crime seriousness increases, participants were more likely to choose a parallel restorative justice approach without impact on sentencing, while they rated a purely retributive sentencing process as highly appropriate. However, neither worldview was examined as a mediator of the relationship between the hypothesised justice choice preference or appropriateness rating of the justice option.

The study combines literature review with interviews of ESG managers and experts to answer how companies can adjust to the current uncertainty. The research reveals five key aspects of corporate ESG strategy. Firstly, potential value creation should be the primary driver for ESG investments. Companies are advised to focus on long-term planning and goal-setting rather than agility. Effective stakeholder and value chain communication can drive value creation for the company and its entire ecosystem. While data management and technology will be crucial in the future, current priorities should be establishing proper processes and data streams. Lastly, organizational structure plays a vital role in internal processes and departmental collaboration for data gathering and reporting. Experts predict sustainability will become a core business procedure, with additional regulations coming over the next years.

106997,Gender Bias in Family Courts : How Does Gender Influence Custody Decisions when Intimate Partner Violence Is Involved?,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106997,"Literature established that family court proceedings in custody disputes lack objectivity, and mothers are disadvantaged in court when raising Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) allegations towards the father. Moreover, case studies have shown that the court tends to give more weight to the father's testimony, and the credibility of the mother decreases when the father makes alienation claims. This study posed a first experimental approach in the literature to confirm prior case studies and literature reviews. Using a novel design, we created a 2 (gender of the parent: male and female) x 3 (IPV Condition: No IPV, IPV Allegation, IPV + Alienation) within-subject design which investigated the effect of the independent variables parent gender and IPV condition on custody decision in favour of the mother, the father, a third party, or shared custody (dependent variable). Six family court case vignettes are provided to each participant, who is then asked to imagine themselves serving as the judge in each scenario. Contrary to previous studies, we found no disadvantage towards mothers, nor a perceived decrease in credibility. Notably, victims, regardless of gender, received a higher credibility rating than the abuser, across conditions. The findings suggest that gender does not appear to be the primary factor influencing this effect.  However, we found that the gender of the judge affected custody decisions. Female participants in this study more often assigned sole custody to the mother when she raised IPV allegations, whereas male participants tended to prefer shared custody, regardless of whether IPV was mentioned. Conclusively, this study could not confirm prior case study literature referring to a sole gender bias towards litigants, but suggested that this issue might include underlying mechanisms like the gender of the judge, influencing the custody decisions.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Gross, N.",July 2025,English,"No

Dark Souls trilogy and partake in online communities built around them. A challenge run is a 
popular metagame in which players build on a game’s mechanical framework and create new 
approaches to playing by challenging themselves to reach goals within the game while 
voluntarily restricting access to key mechanics like levelling up. To investigate how common 
motivators for play carry over to metagames, challenge runners’ motivations were studied 
through the lenses of Self-Determination, Hard Fun and Fiero, Flow and Social Cognitive 
Theory. This study’s findings are applicable to game development, demonstrating how games 
can be designed with autonomy and competence in mind to facilitate prolonged engagement 
and relevance.
Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with casual and elite challenge 
runners that participate in relevant communities and analyzed through open coding followed 
by axial coding. Participants appear mainly motivated by a desire to experience triumph in a 
game that ceased to facilitate Fiero as decreasing effort and frustration preceded in-game 
success after long-term engagement. Challenge runs allow for strategizing and growth of 
knowledge and skill, satisfying autonomy and competence needs. Participants report 
experiencing Flow when challenge and skill are balanced as well as boredom and anxiety 
when one outweighed the other. From a social perspective, motivation to challenge run was 
built through observation and imitation of modelled behavior, reinforced by encouragement 
and assistance received from peers. Lastly, external motivators are relevant to highly skilled 
players. This study argues that players creatively appropriate games to satisfy their basic 
needs, facilitate immersion and moments of triumph and participate in communities that

This challenges users’ self-regulation and raises concerns about the impact on mental health. This study aims to examine the relationship between TikTok usage, mental health, and self-regulation, including the moderating roles of motivation to regulate TikTok usage and Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) in these relationships. Method: A quantitative research method was employed using an online survey (N = 164), including TikTok users aged 18 to 31 years. Participants' TikTok usage and level of self-regulation, anxiety, stress, depression, motivation to regulate TikTok usage, and FoMO were measured. Data were analyzed by performing bootstrapped linear regression and moderation analysis, and non-parametric correlation. Results: The findings revealed a significant association between TikTok usage and mental health, while no significant relationship between self-regulation and TikTok usage was found. Motivation and FoMO did not significantly moderate these relationships.

Furthermore, cognitive appraisals significantly influence subjective responses and reactions to stress and are influenced by personality characteristics, such extraversion, which has repeatedly shown its positive effects on stress views. This study examines the effect of real-time stress feedback from wearable devices on stress appraisals in daily life, with extraversion as a moderating factor. A repeated-measures design with 75 participants (M age = 27.59, 63% female, 37% male) compared the stress appraisals across three questionnaires, during the baseline, after a week wearing and one without a stress feedback device. Participants wore a Garmin smartwatch that provided real-time stress feedback and stress appraisals were measured using an eight-item scale administered after each condition. Extraversion was evaluated using a three-item scale during baseline. The findings showed that wearable stress feedback did not significantly affect stress appraisals in this sample, as participants’ scores remained stable across all conditions. Additionally, although individuals low in extraversion tended to perceive stressors as more threatening, extraversion did not significantly moderate the impact of the wearable.

106988,Automated Liver Vein Segmentation in Preoperative Roadmapping Using Non-Contrast MRI,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106988,"Background: Budd-Chiari Syndrome (BCS) is a rare hepatic vascular disorder characterised by obstruction of hepatic venous outflow. Detailed venous imaging is crucial for preoperative planning. Current imaging techniques often rely on ionising radiation combined with iodine contrast medium, posing health risks to patients. Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is typically performed using gadolinium-based contrast agents, which also carry potential risks. This study investigates whether a deep learning model can accurately segment the hepatic veins on non-contrast MRI using a balanced Steady-State Free Precession (b-SSFP) sequence. Methods: An nnU-Net v2 model was trained on 23 annotated datasets acquired at Radboud University Medical Center (Nijmegen, Netherlands) using a 3 Tesla MRI scanner. Model validation was performed on data from four healthy volunteers scanned with a 1.5T MRI at the University of Twente (Enschede, Netherlands). Quantitative analysis was performed by calculating an average Dice score, sensitivity, and specificity. For qualitative analysis, a 3D reconstruction was created for visual assessment. Additionally, a 3D-printed silicone liver phantom with hollow veins was developed, and a catheter-based intervention was simulated as an in-vitro experiment to assess clinical applicability. Results: The model achieved an average Dice score of 0.88, sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 1.00 on the independent validation set. Visual analysis showed accurate segmentation of the major hepatic veins. Discrepancies between AI- and manual segmentation were found in smaller peripheral branches, which can be filtered out through post-processing. Conclusion: The trained model can accurately segment veins on non-contrast MRI. This technique has potential for clinical implementation in preoperative roadmapping and, in the future, intraoperative guidance, offering a safer alternative to contrast-enhanced imaging.",Bachelor Biomedical Engineering (B-BMT),"Sallevelt, J.C.J.",June 2025,English,"No

However, existing research on biases influencing the perceived credibility of psychologists in court is primarily based on the U.S. context and may not generalize to Germany. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate which biases affect individuals’ evaluations of psychologists’ credibility in the German context. It was hypothesized that psychologists displaying higher confidence or holding a doctoral degree would be perceived as more credible and that this effect would be magnified when both factors are present. Thus, the study employed a mixed-methods, between-subjects 2 (PhD vs. no PhD) x 2 (high confidence vs. low confidence) design and collected data from 156 members of the German public via an online survey. While the self-reported credibility ratings revealed no significant main or interaction effects, the results on participants’ identification of key text passages indicated significantly more favorable evaluations for psychologists with doctoral degrees and higher confidence levels, but this effect was weakened when both were present. The findings imply that these biases may still operate on an implicit level even when attempts are made to remain objective. Thereby, the findings can help expert witnesses to mitigate biases against them and enhance the preparation and training of legal actors, especially for lay judges. The current study is the first to shed light on the evaluative process of credibility judgments in German courts and highlights the need for further investigation.

To neutralize their arguments and avoid responsibility, Incels commonly condemn their condemners by assigning blame for their lack of romantic relationship to feminists. This study focuses on how the general public perceives forum posts made by members of the Incel community. Utilizing a repeated measures design, 108 participants were presented with four fictious forum posts and asked for their blame attribution as well judgements of morality, acceptability and harm perception. The posts differed in their message frame, containing a self-blaming rhetoric or condemning the condemners and expressed either medium or low severity of derogatory language. Compared to a self-blaming message, participants assigned higher responsibility to the Incel when he was blaming feminists. They also judged the posts to be less socially acceptable and perceived higher intentional harm done to feminists. These effects were higher when the Incel used more derogatory language in his arguments. This study therefore demonstrated that by condemning their condemners, Incels do not seem to convince outgroup individuals of their blamelessness. However, the effect of such rhetoric on the ingroup is not yet known. Thereby, this study provides insight into the communication of Incels and how their arguments are perceived while also underlining how further research can utilize these findings to expand the understanding of the continuously growing and polarizing Incel community.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Krawinkel, J.S.",June 2025,English,"No

Specifically, the study tested hypotheses derived from each theory regarding reaction time (RT), accuracy, and EEG theta power across eight conditions that varied in compatibility (compatible/incompatible) and response transition (repeat/alternate). Participants completed a flanker task while EEG data were recorded. CA predictions were all correct, while BRAC predictions only partially correct. Some findings deviated from BRAC predictions, suggesting that motor response repetition may dominate retrieval under conditions of prior conflict. Posterior theta activity was biggest for sequences following incompatible trials relative to compatible trials, while also affected by some of the feature binding effects. These results suggest that neither theory alone fully accounts for the observed behavioral and neural dynamics.

106976,Implementation of the baroreflex-mediated venoconstriction component in a maternal hemodynamic lumped-compartment model,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106976,"Objective: Maternal hemodynamic changes during pregnancy are critical for ensuring healthy outcomes. Understanding and predicting these changes is essential for the early detection of complications, such as pre-eclampsia. Mathematical models provide valuable insights into human physiology and support clinical decision-making. Radboudumc is developing a hemodynamic lumped-compartment model to simulate maternal hemodynamic changes. This study aims to implement the baroreflex-mediated venoconstriction component in this hemodynamic model to improve its ability to simulate maternal blood pressure regulation. Methods: The venoconstriction component was added to the hemodynamic model by incorporating venous compliance and unstressed volume. Five model configurations were evaluated: a baseline model, a control model without baroreflex, and three models incorporating either venous compliance, unstressed volume or both. Simulations included a head-up tilt test to evoke baroreflex responses. Primary outcome parameters were aortic pressure, heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, vena cava pressure, and baroreflex control factors.
For validation, the model outputs were compared with clinical data of 44 healthy non-pregnant women. Results: Simulations showed that the models incorporating baroreflex-mediated adjustments showed improved blood pressure regulation compared to the control model. These models maintained a higher aortic pressure and improved better alignment with clinical data. Conclusion: The incorporation of the venous compliance and unstressed volume brought the model one step closer to a complete representation of the baroreflex. This advancement not only enhances the model's physiological accuracy, but also led to new research directions. It contributed to the goal of Radboudumc for clinical application in studying, predicting and simulating (patho)physiological changes during pregnancy.",Bachelor Technical Medicine (B-TG),"Gille, S., Hoepelman, T., Spaandonk, M. van, Kleinhout, L.",June 2025,English,"No.

106975,The Impact of Currency Risk and Loan Originator Creditworthiness on Cross-Border P2P Lending Rates on Mintos,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106975,"This study investigates the effects of loan originator creditworthiness (proxied by the Mintos risk score) and exchange rate volatility on the interest rates of cross-border peer-to-peer (P2P) loans on Mintos, the largest Euro-denominated P2P lending platform. The paper uses a dataset of 727,812 loans originated in eight countries over the period of 2022 to 2024, to perform a multiple regression. The findings suggest that loan originator creditworthiness has an economically significant negative effect on the expected lending rates on the platform. In addition to this, findings suggest that exchange rate volatility between the lender and borrower country has an economically significant positive effect on the expected lending rates on the platform. Among the several broader factors investigated in the paper, macroeconomic factors explain the majority of the variance in cross-border P2P loan interest rates. Robustness checks—including year-by-year, country-by-country, and median regression analyses—confirm the stability of these relationships. This study contributes to existing literature by further affirming the importance of borrower creditworthiness on the pricing of P2P loans and offering novel empirical evidence on the effect of exchange rate volatility in the pricing of cross-border P2P loan rates.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Yamashita, Toma",June 2025,English,"No

During this study, we assess the usability of the current state of Document AI for automatic information extraction from sustainability reports, to address the gap of the inability of another frequently used method for information extraction, namely LLMs, to capture visual data from the document. First, we determine the requirements for an information extraction tool used for sustainability benchmarking together with four sustainability reporting experts. Second, we evaluate the performance of publicly available methods on sustainability reporting data, and third, we aim to adapt the best model to a sustainability reporting setting. We show how quantized low-rank adaption fine-tuning and hypothetical document embeddings can improve Document AI models in a sustainability reporting setting, by increasing the retrieval performance of a state-of-the-art page-retrieval model, while significantly reducing the required memory. In addition, we show that an automatic fine-tuning pipeline can effectively increase the performance of this retrieval model while reducing the time needed to apply fine-tuning.

From the perspective of the Affordance Competition Hypothesis, action-relevant stimuli simultaneously activate multiple motor plans that must be filtered and selected based on task demands.
	In this study, a modified Eriksen Flanker Task was used to shed light on the contributions of stimulus congruency and response compatibility to cognitive control. Behavioural, time-frequency, and topographical EEG analyses focused on posterior theta band (4-8 Hz) activity. Fourteen participants performed a single version of the task while EEG data were recorded from parieto-occipital sites.
	Reaction time and accuracy data revealed additive costs of visual and motor conflict, with the slowest and least accurate responses observed in incompatible-incongruent trials. EEG results showed increased posterior theta power incompatible-incongruent conditions, especially between 150-250 ms post-stimulus.

Focusing on ASML's complex environment characterized by volatile demand and shared capacity constraints, it proposes a capacity-aware base-stock policy combined with adaptive allocation rules, significantly outperforming traditional methods. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to dynamically refine decisions further. Extensive results, in our non-trivial cases, show that our heuristic approach alone captures 90–95% of possible cost savings, reduces inventory by up to 30%, and runs efficiently (under 30 seconds for larger systems). The DRL enhancement provides an extra 1–5% cost reduction and improved service levels with smart insights for inventory planners.

As these patches pass through choked nozzles, they generate upstream-traveling acoustic waves that can trigger thermoacoustic instabilities in gas turbines and rocket engines. Such instabilities pose serious design challenges, as they may lead to degraded performance or even catastrophic failure. This research uses two-dimensional Euler-based numerical simulations to investigate entropy patch interactions with choked nozzles. The primary objective was to determine under which conditions the acoustic response can be accurately captured using simplified, linear reduced-order models. Two modeling approaches were examined: the quasi-steady model and the inertial model. These models differ fundamentally in their treatment of the sound-generation mechanism. A key outcome of the study is the identification of a critical dimensionless length scales that determine the applicability of each modeling regime. A second dimensionless parameter, the entropy patch strength, was introduced to evaluate the limits of linearization. Results show that for sufficiently strong disturbances, nonlinear effects dominate, rendering linear models inadequate.

While previous research has explored the effectiveness of individual sensory modalities such as visual, auditory, and haptic feedback, limited attention has been given to their combined effects. This study investigated how combinations of auditory, haptic, and visual feedback influence navigation time, confidence in the navigation system, and perceived level difficulty in a virtual reality (VR) navigation scenario. 18 participants completed navigation tasks in a VR simulation of a building, experiencing three different feedback conditions: auditory & haptic, visual & haptic, and visual & auditory. The results showed significant differences in confidence ratings across conditions, with participants reporting the highest confidence in the auditory and haptic condition. However, no significant differences were found in navigation times or perceived level difficulty between conditions. Qualitative feedback further revealed that participants preferred the auditory-haptic combination for its intuitiveness and ease of use. These findings align with theories of human perception and decision making, suggesting that multimodal feedback enhances both cognitive processing and perceived control, ultimately improving user experience during evacuation.

A qualitative research design was adopted, following a mixed-method approach in data collection – conducting both survey and semi-structured interviews. Data from 10 novice entrepreneurs were then analyzed through the combination of abductive approach and the Gioia method. This allowed for a flexible yet systematic analysis of the data with existing theories. In the findings, effectual entrepreneurs tend to trust GenAI and they utilize the technology to help them maximize their available means, set acceptable losses, and operate under uncertainty. In contrast, causal entrepreneurs favoured manually doing tasks such as creating business plans and analyzing the market, exhibiting distrust in GenAI. In summary, this study suggests that depending on how the entrepreneurs view GenAI and what role it has in their decision- making, trust in the technology can significantly shape their entrepreneurial decision- making approaches. Entrepreneurs with high trust are more likely to adopt effectual decision-making approaches as they see GenAI with a role of an exploratory partner, as well as a tool that allows them to embrace contingency and leverage existing means.

Shifting non-core tasks from highly skilled staff to supporting staff may be a solution. However, there is currently insufficient knowledge on factors influencing the implementation, such as job satisfaction, task- and relationship-centeredness and their willingness to task shift. Study aim: This study aimed to gain insight into job satisfaction, willingness to task shift, and the optimal combination of job responsibilities of nurses, verzorgenden IG, helpenden plus, and helpenden from Zorgfederatie Oldenzaal and Zorggroep Sint Maarten. Methodology: A quantitative survey with a 7-point Likert scale. An interview with a verzorgende IG was held to validate the findings. Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed using ANOVA and Pearson tests. Results: 57 respondents (15 nurses, 29 verzorgenden IG, 9 helpenden plus, 4 helpenden) reported high job satisfaction (83.3%), especially nurses (93.3%). Respondents were least satisfied with communication and collaboration. They were most satisfied with their authority and workload. Nurses were most willing to task shift. Non-healthcare related tasks were most valued by nurses, while other job positions valued care-related tasks the most. Conclusion: Possible practical implications of task shifting are shifting non-healthcare related tasks from nurses to verzorgenden IG and shifting facility-related and logistical tasks from verzorgenden IG to helpenden plus. By adhering to the recommended considerations, the implementation of task shifting can be better aligned with the perceptions of healthcare workers, which can improve the execution in nursing homes.

The outcome illustrates that diversity in marketing campaigns has a favourable influence on brand attachment and trust, where brand trust plays an important role in the increase of brand loyalty. Furthermore, it was found that brand attachment does not significantly influence brand loyalty. Besides that, the moderating role of group fit, how much consumers identify with those represented, was not established as significant. The results add to the diversity marketing literature and provide practical insights to brands that are looking to create brand loyalty by using authentic representation in the markets that are becoming increasingly diverse.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Altay, Arailym",June 2025,English,"No

106944,"Understanding the Yerkes-Dodson law of arousal, affect, and workload when performing a motor sequencing task",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106944,"The Yerkes-Dodson law was initially proposed by Yerkes and Dodson (1908) and predicts a quadratic relationship between arousal and performance, where moderate arousal facilitates performance while insufficient and excessive arousal diminish it. Although over a century of research in motor sequence learning has yielded mixed results, the theory is widely known among psychologists (Winton, 1987). This thesis evaluates the theory with more naturalistic observations by adopting the Dance Step-Sequence Production (DS-DSP) task, a dance motor sequence learning paradigm developed by Chan et al. (2025). We recruited 16 healthy individuals to perform the experiment and combined self-report data with reaction time data to determine the functional relationships that arousal, pleasure, and mental workload share with performance. The results of linear and quadratic regression analyses provided minimal evidence for the theory in the experiment. Only frustration, a subdimension of mental workload, was significantly related to reaction time in a quadratic function (p = 0.03), and only temporal demand significantly affected reaction time in a linear function (p = 0.03). These findings suggest that psychologists should approach theories and frameworks with caution and emphasize the need for more replication studies. We discuss potential explanations for these findings and provide directions for future work.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Smoor, Jakob Jonael",June 2025,English,"No

106940,Financial literacy and Value orientation on ESG Investing : A Causal analysis with Endogeneity correction,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106940,"This study investigates how investor characteristics—financial literacy, altruism, and materialism—influence attitudes toward ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing, and to what these relationships change when correcting for endogeneity. The research applies both the Knowledge–Attitude–Behavior (KAB) model, extended by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and the Value–Attitude–Behavior (VAB) model to provide a multidimensional explanation of ESG attitude formation. Data were collected through an online survey of 274 participants. The analysis employed Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) regression to address potential endogeneity in financial literacy. Findings indicate that altruism is positively associated with favorable ESG attitudes, while materialism shows a negative association. Financial literacy was initially positively correlated with ESG attitudes but became statistically insignificant after endogeneity correction. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and income had limited explanatory power. These results suggest that value orientations may exert a more stable influence on ESG attitudes than financial knowledge, particularly when accounting for endogenous traits. The joint application of KAB+TPB and VAB frameworks provides theoretical support for including both cognitive and motivational pathways in attitude modeling. Practically, the findings highlight the need for investor engagement strategies that align with underlying value profiles, rather than relying solely on financial education to promote ESG investing.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Ahn, Hee Soo",June 2025,English,"No.

This design is different from most AI tools that focus on automation, as the intention with this design is to have learners engage in tasks first and then engage in theory, with the goal of triggering inquiry, reflection, and ownership in their own learning. The study looked at two tools used in practice from the Aisystant platform: a task-based simulator and a Telegram AI tutor. Nine users from active study groups were interviewed, and the data was analyzed thematically. Cognitive and educational processes of agency were demonstrated through six mechanisms: learners were given agency through autonomy, cognitive activation through uncertainty and confabulation, reflective writing, intrinsic motivation, meaningful feedback, and agentic engagement. Findings were consistent with constructivist theory, which states that learners form their understanding of theory through experience. Three implications for design principles for AI agents are proposed: support flexible pathways, use uncertainty with a purpose, and provide reflective feedback.

106934,The Impact of Rainbow-Washing on Consumers’ Emotional Responses,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106934,"Nowadays, LGBTQ+ representation in advertisements is common. However, these advertisements are not always perceived as sincere. Some people believe that LGBTQ+ advertising is mostly done for external reasons such as gaining profits. The public support shown for LGBTQ+ communities shown by businesses while privately acting and engaging in contradictory practices is called rainbow-washing. This research focuses on the impact of perceiving rainbow-washing on consumers’ emotional responses. In order to examine this, a survey was conducted among 134 participants, in which respondents had to watch an advertisement that features LGBTQ+ representation and select the main emotion they felt. The Geneva Emotional Wheel was used to measure emotions. It was found that perceiving rainbow-washing leads to lower emotional valence. Individuals who perceived rainbow-washing were more prone to experience feelings of boredom and disgust compared to respondents who did not perceive rainbow-washing. Those consumers perceived consistently positive reactions, including hope and happiness. Moreover, it has been found that LGBTQ+ identity alone does not significantly predict emotional valence, which suggests that perception is the key driver of emotional responses in this context. This study expands research in consumer behaviour and ethical marketing. For brands, it means that they should prioritise genuine inclusion to avoid negative consumer reactions and use transparent marketing strategies to protect their reputation.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Leeuwen, Caitlin van",January 2025,English,"No

However, people don’t always respond to AI based on what they know - but often on how these tools make them feel. This study builds on the work of Tully et al. (2024), which states that people with less technical knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI) can be more open to using it, since they see it as something magical or awe-inspiring. To explore whether this also applies in a diverse, international context, a survey with 121 students and staff at the University of Twente was conducted. The results confirmed the original finding: those who knew less about how AI works were more likely to view it as something fascinating and mysterious—and were more willing to embrace it. On the other hand, people who had a better grasp of the technology tended to be more cautious, especially when AI was used in roles that feel human, like making decisions or having conversations. Interestingly, when AI was used for more straightforward tasks, like sorting or calculations, technically knowledgeable participants were more receptive. Based on data analysis it was possible to identify that cultural background didn’t seem to make a big difference in how people responded, suggesting that these reactions are universal and do not depend on cultural factors of nationality. This study not only validates, but  goes beyond Tully et al. (2024) findings in for it shows that individuals do not accept AI only because they understand it, the sense of wonder the technology offers is also an important variable.

Whilst customer segmentation has been heavily explored within business-to-consumer (B2C) markets, the business-to-business (B2B) sector, in comparison, is quite underexplored. The nature of the B2B environment and its relationships, including longer sales cycles and customized solutions, result in more complex solutions to tackling customer segmentation. Therefore, this research aims at analyzing customer segmentation in B2B markets and exploring how different B2B firms conduct customer segmentation, including their key success factors, methodologies used, and major challenges encountered. Additionally, to address the research gap, a qualitative multiple-case study approach is used, which combines theoretical insights with empirical data. This research contributes to a more enhanced understanding of customer segmentation in B2B markets through the combination of theoretical insights with empirical data from multiple firms and industries. The findings highlight cross-industry B2B practices and methods, as well as discovering common success factors and challenges in B2B customer segmentation.

Participants report in real time how lonely they feel and what their mood is like. A total of 33 students took part and provided information three times a day over a 14-day period. This allowed fluctuations in everyday life to be precisely recorded. The results show that loneliness and mood influence each other, but to varying degrees. Higher levels of loneliness are associated with a worse mood, while a positive mood reduces loneliness. It is particularly striking that loneliness has a stronger and lasting influence on mood than vice versa. Delayed analyses confirm that loneliness plays a central role in students' well-being in the long term. The study emphasizes the importance of targeting loneliness in the university context and shows the usefulness of real-time measurements to capture emotional fluctuations in everyday life.

The findings indicate that nearly all auditors characterized explainability as a necessary precondition to usefulness. Auditors accept high performing AI tools only if the outputs are interpretable and defensible. Subsequently, the findings challenge the often ambiguous but accepted notion that there is a trade-off between performance and explainability; we, rather, hypothesize that there is a dependence between performance and explainability.

106921,A quantitative study on the moderating effect of  relationship strength on the decision to bridge or  buffer as a response to perceived resource scarcity.,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106921,"Firms facing resource scarcity must make strategic decisions about how to manage 
the emerging risks, often by either distancing themselves from suppliers (buffering) 
or increasing collaboration (bridging). While existing studies have thoroughly 
examined resource scarcity, they typically treat it as a single construct, overlooking 
how different dimensions of scarcity may influence strategic decision-making. 
Moreover, the potential role of relationship strength in shaping these decisions 
remains unclear. This thesis investigates how two dimensions of perceived resource 
scarcity, expected resource scarcity (ERS) and scarcity uncertainty (SU), affect firms’ 
adoption of bridging or buffering strategies, and whether these effects are moderated 
by relationship strength. A survey of 45 purchasing professionals was analyzed using 
multiple regression analyses. The results show that only scarcity uncertainty 
significantly influences firm behavior, specifically by reducing the use of bridging 
strategies. No significant effect was found for expected resource scarcity, and 
relationship strength did not moderate either relationship. These findings extend

This study addresses that gap by examining the attitudes, perceived challenges, and motivations of the University of Twente (UT) community regarding zero-waste shopping. Using a qualitative approach, five focus groups and ten interviews were conducted with a total of 37 students and staff members. Thematic analysis revealed that although most participants held positive attitudes towards zero-waste stores, few expressed a clear intention to use them. Key perceived barriers included inconvenience, price, and incompatibility with existing lifestyles. Motivations for sustainable behaviour were largely egoistic, rather than altruistic concern for the environment.

Exploring the Role of AI- and Feedback Literacy in Student Feedback Perceptions,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106917,"As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) becomes increasingly integrated into education, it is essential to comprehend students’ perceptions of GenAI-generated feedback. This study examined how these perceptions are shaped by two key competencies: feedback literacy and AI literacy, focusing on university students’ evaluations of feedback from both GenAI and human teachers. 
In a study employing a within-subjects experimental design (N = 73), participants assessed two pieces of feedback, one from a teacher and one from GenAI, both before and after the revelation of the feedback source. Results showed that evaluations were significantly affected by source awareness: GenAI-generated feedback was rated less favourably once its source was revealed, whereas teacher feedback was rated more favourably. Higher feedback literacy and AI literacy correlated with more positive evaluations of GenAI-generated feedback, with feedback literacy emerging as the more significant predictor. 
While the study provides new perspectives on the influence of these literacies on feedback perceptions, its small, demographically limited sample and dependence on self-report data limit the ability to generalize findings.

The research uses a dataset of 198 IPOs between 2010 and 2023, with firms classified as VC-backed if they held a minimum 25% equity stake at the time of listing. Six hypotheses were tested, including IPO underpricing, long-term stock performance, revenue and profit growth, and the moderating roles of VC stake and IPO size. The findings show that VC backing offers operational rather than market-based advantages within the Western European market context. While it does not guarantee superior IPO pricing or shareholder returns, it supports business expansion in the critical post-IPO phase.

106912,Mediating Multiple Generative-AI Tools in Academic Work,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106912,"As generative AI (GenAI) tools become increasingly embedded in academic workflows, academics are not only becoming users of individual systems but also learning to interact with and navigate multiple platforms that have different capabilities, limitations, and epistemic assumptions. This thesis explores how academic users mediate between multiple GenAI systems in their knowledge work. Using qualitative data from 12 semi-structured interviews with academics, the study applies the Gioia methodology to develop a grounded model of GenAI orchestration. Four aggregate dimensions were identified: frictions in interfacing with GenAI, tactics for coordinating tools, strategic mediation and transformational learning and identity. These were linked through three underlying mechanisms: epistemic calibration, delegation as coping and value-driven bricolage. These mechanisms reveal how users adapt to uncertainty, manage overload and align GenAI practices with personal and pedagogical values. The study presents a dynamic, non-linear model of GenAi integration that foregrounds user agency, reflective adaptation and contextual negotiation. These findings offer conceptual insight into how GenAI can reshape academic practice and identity, with implications for pedagogy and tool design in higher education.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Veen, L.R. van der",June 2025,English,"No

This study explores the role that Islam plays in the professional lives of higher-educated Muslims in the Dutch work context. Through qualitative interviews with five practicing higher-educated Muslim professionals born and raised in the Netherlands, this thesis aims to understand which Islamic values are relevant in professional settings, how these values influence behavior, and how tensions with Dutch workplace culture are navigated. For all the interviewees, Islam is not only a religion they practice at certain times in the day, but rather it is an all-encompassing way of living that influences their way of thinking, handling, and decision-making. The interviewees expressed that Islamic values are important guidelines for their professional behavior. The existing misunderstandings about Islam arise from ignorance or little knowledge of Islam, especially among non-Muslim colleagues. Asking for religious accommodation at work is strongly related to the degree of flexibility within the organization. The way organizations deal with accommodating religion differs strongly and is influenced by different factors like diversity policies, personal experiences of employees, and the overall culture within the organization. Combining work and religion is not only a possibility but is also seen as valuable by the interviewees. The findings show that higher-educated Muslim professionals have different strategies to avoid tensions at work between their religious beliefs and the expectations on the work floor. A new insight that emerged is the generational difference: compared to their parents, the interviewees practice Islam in a more reflective and knowledge-based way, showing how they combine their faith with Dutch values like openness and critical thinking. Dutch organizations can still gain a lot by dealing more consciously with religious diversity.

Engagement strategies can be applied to DMHIs to mitigate attrition. A tool which can possibly supplement these strategies is Artificial Intelligence (AI). This qualitative study sought to explore the attitudes of young adults towards DMHIs, primarily but not limited to those which incorporate AI features in their design in order to promote engagement. A focus group study was conducted with 14 participants between the ages of 20 and 25. The main findings of this study revolved around ethics, data handling, human interaction, and personalisation. Participants were generally sceptical of DMHIs, in large part due to the personal data required of them. Furthermore, human interaction and connection emerged as key priorities for the participants, and they were therefore less inclined to consider using a standalone DMHI or purely large language model-based intervention. The primary benefit of using AI as an engagement tool, identified by the participants, was the option of extensive personalisation. Implications of this study include the importance of human support, the possibility of implementing AI to enhance engagement strategies, and the value of transparency with users when utilising AI.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Opdahl, L.D.",June 2025,English,"No

106908,Reducing Fatigue Through Cognitive Bias Modification : A Pilot Study on the Role of Stress Vulnerability,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106908,"This study explored the relationship between perceived stress, fatigue, and interpretation bias, and whether a brief cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) intervention could shift fatigue-related thinking. Prior research suggests that high stress vulnerability is linked to greater fatigue, possibly due to negative interpretation patterns. Thirty-five participants completed self-report measures of stress and fatigue and an interpretation bias task before and after a three-day CBM-I training. The intervention used 30 ambiguous scenarios per session to promote more adaptive thinking. Paired t-tests and linear mixed-effects models were used to assess change and moderation by stress. Higher perceived stress was significantly associated with greater fatigue. However, no significant changes were found in interpretation bias or fatigue after the intervention. Stress did not moderate these changes, and bias and fatigue were not correlated at baseline. These results suggest the short intervention may have been insufficient to produce measurable change. The interpretation bias task, developed specifically for this study, may have lacked sensitivity due to limited prior validation. Overall, the findings support the connection between stress and fatigue and highlight the need for improved measurement tools and more intensive or personalized interventions in future research.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Ahmed, Naslin",June 2025,English,"No

While CBMs promise long-term benefits, like cost savings, new revenue, and risk reduction, they also involve short-term challenges, including high upfront costs and uncertain returns. These trade-offs depend on factors such as firm size, sector, and regulatory support. To help firms navigate this complexity, the study introduces the CIRCLE Framework: a six-phase model (Consider – Identify – Redesign – Calculate – Launch – Evaluate) designed to guide circular transitions. Grounded in a systematic literature review of 31 academic sources, the research identifies key financial barriers and drivers, showing that large firms often benefit from scale and resources, while SMEs can leverage flexibility and niche opportunities, if supported by appropriate policies and financing tools. The thesis concludes that balancing short-term financial strain with long-term strategic gains is essential. The CIRCLE Framework provides practical guidance for managers, financial planners, and policymakers to implement financially viable circular strategies.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Grobben, B.A.J.",June 2025,English,"No

106905,Green protecting green : Optimizing permeable structures in mangrove restoration with an analytical model,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106905,"In previous decades, there has been a global reduction of mangrove areas due to 
human influences. To bring back some of the lost mangroves, mangrove restoration 
projects are being implemented. A frequently used method to do so is the use of 
permeable dams. This method is also used in the Demak Region in Indonesia. 
The main objective of this research is to determine to what extent the design of 
permeable structures used in mangrove restoration projects can be optimized using a 
model that computes the depth-variable wave energy transmission of different design 
options. The ‘optimal’ dam design depends on limited material usage and a minimum 
transmitted wave energy.An analytical model is developed that calculates the depth-variable wave energy in the 
water column and the total wave energy. The developed model focuses on 
intermediate wave conditions. This way, it is observed at what water depths the wave 
energy should be ‘dissipated’ to meet the maximum energy that allows for mangrove 
development. Furthermore, horizontal elements are simulated in the model. These 
represent the permeable structures, represented as horizontal bamboo beams 
attached to vertical bamboo poles. Four design options with varying placement of the 
horizontal elements relative to the water level are simulated. For each design option, 
the wave energy reflection, wave energy dissipation, and the resulting transmitted 
wave height are examined. The horizontal elements are represented with dissipation, 
reflection, and transmission coefficients. The maximum wave energy that mangrove 
seedlings at various ages and for all hydrodynamic conditions can withstand is 
calculated. This is called the ‘critical wave energy’. It is examined which of the design 
options reduces the wave height that does not exceed the critical wave energy. The 
model gives good guidance in choosing and analyzing the implementation of different 
design options. It is easy to conclude which design option is the most efficient one. At 
last, the model output is used to determine the optimal design. The Design option 
where a gap between the seabed and the last horizontal element increases is 
considered to be the optimal design option. A specific design with specified placements 
of the horizontal elements is, however, not advised, since it is condition and site-
specific. Finally, expert elicitation clarifies the practical applicability of the model in the 
field. The expert elicitation clarified the practical applicability of such a model in the 
field. It also helped determine the risks of assumptions and simplifications made. It is 
recommended to conduct a stability analysis of the structure in further research. 
Furthermore, it is recommended to implement morphodynamic and socio-economic 
processes into the model and the design phase.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"Jacobs, Dimphy",June 2025,English,"No

106904,Observed Psychological Safety in Agile Teams : A Comparison Across Cultures and Conflict Management Effectiveness,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106904,"To remain competitive many organisations have shifted from traditional to Agile methodologies. Key characteristics of
Agile organisations, such as speed, adaptability and self-management, allow them to thrive in unpredictable and fast-
changing environments. However, for Agile teams to function effectively, a strong foundation of psychological safety is
essential. Most research on psychological safety relies on self-reported measures, limiting objectivity. Addressing this
gap, this study adopts a mixed-methods approach, combining survey data and video-recorded team meetings to examine
verbal and non-verbal behavioural indicators of psychological safety in mono- and multicultural Agile teams with
varying levels of conflict management effectiveness. Teams with higher conflict management effectiveness displayed
more frequent and longer-lasting behaviours indicative of psychological safety, while exhibiting fewer behaviours
associated with low psychological safety. Multicultural teams demonstrated higher levels of silence behaviours, and fewer
voice and familiarity behaviours compared to monocultural teams, suggesting that cultural diversity may create
communication barriers affecting psychological safety. Although not statistically significant, these patterns provide
meaningful insights. This study contributes to the literature by offering an objective, behaviour-based assessment of
psychological safety and presents practical implications for Agile coaches and organisations aiming to foster
psychological safety, especially in culturally diverse teams.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Veltkamp, M.S.M.",June 2025,English,"No

106903,Aligning ProcurCompEU Competencies with Healthcare Innovation and Procurement of Innovation Challenges: A Systematic Literature Review,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106903,"The future of European healthcare faces a difficult path forward. With ageing populations, increasing healthcare demands, and escalating sustainability issues, the industry is under more pressure than ever to innovate. The healthcare procurement function, as the acquirer of innovation sourcing and implementation, thus faces a strong strategic responsibility to achieve these innovations, remedying these difficulties through increased labour productivity and sustainability. However, due to the stated challenges of rising costs, expenditures, and labour shortages, most healthcare procurement follows a cost-focused approach. This is problematic, as research shows a cost-focused approach negatively correlates with innovation sourcing & implementation. Managing costs and innovations requires innovation competencies, which are further complicated by organisational issues, a lack of R&D funding in healthcare organisations, and limited research on procurement innovation competencies, specifically in the intersection of sustainability, innovation, and healthcare procurement. The ProcurCompEU framework, which was introduced to help professionalise an approach against such challenges in the EU, offers solutions, but only transactionally, meaning sustainable innovation is likely underexplored. This study aims to address this gap, using a systematic literature review to identify and analyse the competencies required for sustainable healthcare innovation. It maps these competencies against the ProcurCompEU framework and evaluates whether they sufficiently address the intersection of healthcare procurement, innovation, and sustainability.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Klucar, Samuel",June 2025,English,"No.

This study examines the effect of the university-level factors, university support and entrepreneurship education, on entrepreneurial intention and how this is moderated by the national cultural values uncertainty avoidance, masculinity and individualism. Results reveal that entrepreneurship education consistently enhances entrepreneurial intention, particularly in cultures with high uncertainty avoidance. In contrast, university support alone shows a negative effect, especially in masculine societies where competitive norms potentially undervalue institutional encouragement.

Despite growing interest in AI, existing research has yet to explore the unique challenges and opportunities start-ups encounter when integrating AI. This is particularly important as these smaller firms operate under different constraints than their incumbent competitors, while driving innovation.  This research addresses this gap qualitatively by conducting interviews and assessing AI’s role as a potential disruptive innovation in biotech. The results show that AI integration by start-ups is increasing their independence and resource efficiency. However, several significant barriers such as poor data quality, limited funding, and constraining regulatory frameworks continue to restrict AI’s potential to fundamentally reshape the biotech industry. Further, the findings suggest that AI in the biotech industry acts as a disruptive enabler, a tool that supports new business models and innovation pathways but is constrained by external barriers to displace incumbent firms. Recommendations include the formation of multidisciplinary advisory teams to bridge the knowledge gap between investors and start-ups to facilitate investment decisions and enable innovative technologies and operational scaling.

Focusing on Bank of America’s unexpected exit from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) on December 31, 2024. This study uses an event study methodology to assess abnormal and cumulative abnormal returns (AR and CAR) across four event windows. The analysis compares two portfolios, each containing the 100 largest green and brown companies by market capitalisation. Results show clear asymmetry, brown firms exhibit statistically significant positive returns over short-term windows (5-day and 10-day), suggesting investors perceived BoA’s exit as easing ESG-related pressure. On the other hand, the green portfolio shows no significant reaction, consistent with the idea that ESG-focused investors are less responsive to isolated events and more driven by long-term values. These findings align with the efficient market hypothesis and signalling theory and highlight how sustainability signals are interpreted differently across sectors, dependent on investor expectations.

106894,Market reactions to hostile & friendly corporate takeovers : an empirical analysis,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106894,"Mergers & Acquisitions represent a central mechanism through which firms 
pursue growth, efficiency and strategic repositioning. Among them, the 
distinction between friendly and hostile takeovers remains a highly debated topic 
in M&A. While friendly takeovers are characterized by cooperation between the 
acquiring firm and the target firm’s management, hostile takeovers occur when 
the acquirer attempts to gain control without the support of the targets board. 
These contrasting dynamics come with different implications for firm 
governance, market perception, and shareholder value. The relevance of this 
topic remains evident in today’s corporate landscape. For instance, Musk’s 
acquisition of Twitter underscored the complexities of hostile acquisitions, 
including board resistance, strategic defenses and investor backlash. However, 
despite practical importance, the empirical evidence on how financial markets 
respond differently to hostile & friendly takeovers remain inconclusive. Many 
studies rely on older datasets or generalize the effect of hostility on target gains, 
without looking deeper into what factors play a role in shareholder value creation. 
This paper addresses this research gap by first defining how literature views 
characteristics of hostile & friendly takeovers, what theoretical underpinnings are 
present, as well as market reaction differences in target and acquiring firms. Next 
to that, this paper analyzes an updated dataset of M&A transactions and using an 
event study methodology to examine cumulative abnormal returns over a short-term event window, followed by a regression analysis that controls for factors

106887,Designing a platform governance framework to reduce price-driven competition in dual-sided marketplaces through customer decision-making mechanisms,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106887,"This thesis investigates how platform design can be used as a governance tool to reduce price-driven competition within dual-sided marketplaces. Focusing on Central Rental (a car rental platform in the Netherlands and Belgium), the study researches how default platform structures can influence customer decision-making and supplier behavior. Through the four-stage design cycle (Exploration, Synthesis, Creation and Evaluation), this research integrates theoretical frameworks and practical insights with interviews, cases and a real-world implementation. 
The main implementation involved the addition of a location-based search filter to Central Rental, allowing users to filter listings on country and province. This minimal change contributes to a significant shift in user behavior, including increased click-through rates on relevant listings. This reduced customer’s focus on price solely. Interviews with suppliers further revealed that low deposits may appeal to users, they pose risks to rental companies. This emphasizes the need for balanced trust mechanisms like verification badges. 
Research confirms that small design changes can shift customer’s focus towards value-based decision-making which helps platforms to promote healthy competition. This thesis proposes a three-layered governance framework which includes interface-level adjustments, supplier verification and transparent trust signals. While implementation was limited due to time constraints, this research demonstrated strong potential for more implementations of this governance framework in future iterations.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Zeyrek, Joël",June 2025,English,"No.

106885,Acquiror Market Performance and Retail Investor Reactions Following M&A Announcement: The Role of Target ESG scores,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106885,"In recent years, there has been an increase in attention to concepts such as sustainability when it comes 
to global business (Nosratabadi et al., 2019). ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) 
considerations have become an integral part of corporate strategies, influencing various aspects of 
decision-making, including investment policies, risk management, and stakeholder relations. 
Companies are increasingly incorporating ESG factors into their operations to ensure long-term value 
creation, regulatory compliance, and reputational benefits. Moreover, ESG considerations play a 
critical role in financial decision-making, as investors and analysts assess firms based on their 
sustainability performance. Given the growing importance of ESG across multiple business dimensions, its role in corporate 
transactions, particularly in M&A deals, has gained significant attention. The dimensions regarding 
ESG matters could help managers in their decision-making process during an M&A deal. With the 
rise of a greater interest in ESG scores, these scores have become a critical factor in the M&A process, 
as they indicate how stakeholders perceive companies’ sustainable actions (Franklin, 2019). Galpin 
and de Vibe (2024) emphasize the importance of ESG scores, showing that companies that ignore ESG 
considerations during M&A processes risk not only losing potential value but also damaging their

Using a large dataset from an MFI in the Netherlands, this research investigates whether borrowers’ social capital can predict loan repayment success, utilizing a keyword-based method. Social capital is operationalized through bonding, bridging, and linking. Bonding (strong ties such as family and close friends) shows the strongest and most consistent predictive power; however, overall results are weak, indicating social capital alone is not a strong predictor of successful loan repayment. This contradicts prior literature that understates the economic role of bonding social capital. Furthermore, it indicates that not all types of soft information are strong predictors of loan repayment success. Limitations of this research stem from the social capital extraction method (keyword search) and the procedures used by loan officers to record soft information. This research encourages MFIs to explore new ways to document soft information.

It is required from expatriate leaders to have the ability to adapt their leadership styles to different regions and teams with members from various nationalities. This thesis explores how Dutch expatriate leaders adapt their leadership style when managing teams in Nigeria. By using a qualitative and emic-based approach, data was collected through semi-structured interviews among five Dutch expatriate leaders working in various sectors in Nigeria. Key themes that emerged include the importance of hierarchical structures, communication norms, work ethic, advanced planning, the impact of expatriate identity and cultural sensitivity. The findings show that core Dutch values, such as direct communication and servant leadership, remain intact. Adaption takes place in terms of hierarchical structures, exhibiting power, the embracement of a more flexible approach to planning and the influence of expatriate identity on workplace dynamics and perceived authority.

While prior studies have looked at investment motivations in global contexts, empirical research in the Netherlands is limited. This study investigates how intrinsic motivators (e.g., curiosity, creativity, trust) and extrinsic motivators (e.g., financial profit, recognition) affect the intention to invest in equity-based crowdfunding campaigns. An online survey with 29 Dutch participants was used to collect data, which was then analyzed in RStudio using binary logistic regression. The results demonstrate that while financial reward had a marginally significant beneficial impact, intrinsic motivators did not significantly predict investment intention. Furthermore, those who were 30 years of age or older were significantly more likely to say that they intended to invest. These results imply that demographic variables like age and financial considerations might be more crucial than previously assumed.

As AI technology increasingly supports audit procedures the need for transparent and explainable systems has become critical. Using a qualitative approach this study conducted semi-structured interviews with audit company representatives from companies such as Deloitte, EY, and Rabobank. The research applies a coding framework based on Explainable AI (XAI) theory to evaluate six criteria: clarity of explanation, user comprehension, trust, model design, transparency, data provenance, and bias detection.The findings of the research reveal that while AI systems offer valuable help in the process of audit tasks, their explainability is often limited to surface-level insights. Model design lacks depth for complex or high-risk engagements. Transparency is low, due to limited access to training data and model logic. This study concludes that AI systems are moderately transparent and explainable and are not technically sufficient enough to deliver a stand-alone value without human intervention.

106875,Evaluating ridership prediction methods for BRT corridors : balancing accuracy and time- efficiency,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106875,"The implementation of Bus Rapid Transit, BRT, within the Netherlands has been a topic of 
discussion for quite some years, as it is a sustainable and cost-effective way of public 
transport. BRT systems, characterized by high service levels and their efficiency, have the 
potential to reduce car dependency and improve regional mobility. While previous studies have 
identified potential BRT corridors, they have not addressed the critical question of expected 
ridership. Accurate ridership forecasting is essential to justify investments in new corridors, yet 
it remains unclear which prediction method offers the best balance between accuracy and 
practical feasibility.
While various methods exist for predicting ridership, it remains unclear which approach offers 
the greatest accuracy and efficiency for the prediction of BRT ridership. Therefore, the aim of 
this research is to find the most accurate and time-efficient prediction method for BRT corridors 
in the Netherlands. The four methods that are being researched are a comparative case study, 
the logit model, a regression model and the gravity model. These methods are assessed using a 
case study of the Assen Kloosterveen-Groningen bus corridor. Once the best method is known 
Keypoint Consultancy can use the tool for their clients. 
The comparative case study relies on identifying a similar corridor using demographic and 
geographic criteria. The logit model uses modal split and transport-related variables to 
estimate demand. The regression model incorporates operational variables and coefficients 
sourced from literature, while the gravity model estimates ridership based on population, 
employment, travel time, and a calibrated scaling constant. A multi-criteria decision analysis 
(MCDA) is used to compare the outcomes and determine the most suitable method. The 
criteria of the MCDA were accuracy, time-efficiency, data availability and computational 
tools/skills needed. 
While the logit model produced the most accurate results, the regression model emerged as 
the most balanced option according to the MCDA. It offers the best trade-off between accuracy 
and time efficiency, making it well-suited for practical application. In contrast, the comparative 
case study method was the least accurate and most time-consuming and is therefore not 
recommended for future use. The gravity model demonstrated a reasonable accuracy but as it 
is connected to the comparative case study, it lacks time-efficiency.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Pronk, Kirsten",June 2025,English,"No

Globalization leads to more cross-cultural business environments, understanding these dynamics becomes essential for effective international collaboration. Existing studies provide a solid foundation for understanding the cultural dynamics between Dutch and German professionals, but the specific context of meetings, and how leadership styles play out during these structured interactions, remains underexplored. Drawing on both etic and emic perspectives, this qualitative study examines how national culture and organizational behavior come together, based on five in-depth interviews with Dutch professionals working at a Dutch company with a German parent company. The study uses the Critical Incident Technique to reveal cultural standards that shape interactions in meetings. Findings reveal that German leadership is generally perceived as more formal, hierarchical, and directive, resulting in structured, punctual, and goal-oriented meetings. Dutch leadership, in contrast, emphasizes egalitarianism, openness, and participative decision-making, fostering informal and flexible meeting cultures. These cultural contrasts manifest in differing expectations regarding communication, decision-making, meeting discipline, and feedback during meetings. Notable challenges include misunderstandings over hierarchy, discomfort with directness or criticism, and differing levels of openness to input, especially from junior staff. However, the study also highlights how mutual adaptation, especially over time and across generations, can soften cultural friction during meetings. The study contributes to academic literature by filling a gap in research on cultural leadership style differences specifically in meeting contexts between Dutch and German professionals.

However, recent studies argue that not all forms of friction negatively impact customer experience by providing evidence that some thoughtfully designed friction can increase consumer value. This thesis examines how different levels of experiential friction affect the customer value experience in e-commerce environments. Based on customer experience, cognitive reflectivity, emotional valence, and the value co-creation and co-destruction framework, this study investigates the effects of low, moderate, and high friction levels in an e-commerce setting. An experiment exposed participants to three simulated checkout journeys, which were later evaluated with a questionnaire that assessed their experience in terms of perceived effort, type of reflection, and emotional response. According to the experiment findings, low friction creates a smooth but shallow customer value experience. In comparison, moderate friction stimulates meaningful cognitive engagement without emotionally overwhelming users, supporting value co-creation. Finally, high friction leads to frustration and emotional decline in customers. This research contributes to the customer experience approach by providing empirical evidence for reflectivity as a mechanism linking friction and value experience.

Specifically, the choice between decision-making logics effectuation and causation, particularly ‘means vs goals’ and ‘affordable loss vs expected returns’. A qualitative approach was applied with six semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs from Twente. Thematic coding was applied, using a deductive approach with a specific focus on dimensions derived from the theoretical framework, such as decision-making, affordable loss vs expected return, regional culture, individualism vs collectivism, and uncertainty avoidance. The findings indicate a strong tendency towards a more effectual logic. Entrepreneurs in Twente, therefore, often begin with their available means, try to work as much as possible with the network they are familiar with, and are flexible in dealing with uncertainties. As a result, all four propositions that were developed from the literature were widely supported by the respondents. This contrasts with national-level culture as described by Hofstede (1980).

106861,Exploring the Mozart Effect on Dutch University Students,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106861,"The increasing use of music in everyday life resulted in growing research on the
effectiveness of background music on emotion and performance. One prominent finding in
this context is that of the Mozart effect, which is described as the positive influence of
exposure to Mozart’s music on emotions and spatio-visual performance. Replication studies
on the Mozart effect show results both consistent and inconsistent with this finding, indicating
a level of inconclusiveness in research on this topic. In an attempt to contribute to the existing
theory on the Mozart effect, the present study explored the effect of exposure to Mozart’s
music on emotions and spatio-temporal skills in Dutch university students. This was done by
having 36 students spend twenty minutes performing a set of three sudoku puzzles, 18 of
which first listening to a Mozart sonata for ten minutes, and all filled out the Positive and
Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) both before and after the task. Results show that neither
students’ emotions nor their performance on the puzzles were influenced by exposure to
Mozart. As no earlier studies in this research area mentioned the use of sudoku puzzles as a
task, further research about the Mozart effect on sudoku performance, as well as other tasks
related to visual pattern analysis, is encouraged. Correcting for musical ability and preference
of music is also advised for future studies, as this was not done in this research, and these
variables are hypothesized to play a considerable role in the Mozart effect.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Klarenbeek, Morrison",June 2025,English,"No.

While traditional bank loans have historically been the primary funding method, an increasing number of SMEs are exploring alternative financing methods such as crowdfunding. These financing choices are not merely financial but also strategic, significantly influencing a firm's economic, social, and long-term sustainability performance. This research investigates how SME leaders in the technology sector strategically make financing decisions when choosing between crowdfunding and bank loans, and how these decisions subsequently affect their businesses across multiple performance areas. The analysis is grounded in three theoretical perspectives: Strategic Decision-Making theory, the Resource-Based View, and the Triple Bottom Line framework. Employing a qualitative, comparative case study approach, this study draws on interviews with SME leaders experienced in either crowdfunding or bank loans, analyzing data thematically through a combination of theory-based and open-ended coding guided by the Gioia methodology.

106853,Understanding the Value Perceptions of Stakeholders of the Chainless DGTL-Drive from a SCOT perspective,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106853,"To date, bicycles rely on traditional chain drive systems, which restricts bicycle design and use opportunities. Van Raam, a company that designs, produces and distributes special bikes for various target groups, developed a chainless drive technology, called chainless DGTL-drive. This technology promises many advantages over traditional chain drives in terms of user friendliness and design opportunties. However, is there a market? What do various target groups think of this new technology? The purpose of this research is to examine these questions, building on a Social Construction Of Technology (SCOT) perspective to show the relationship between several types of stakeholders and their opinions on this novel drivetrain innovation. The participated stakeholders in this study have been divided into their respective social groups to enable a structured and objective approach towards their value perceptions of the product. These groups consist of users, producers, advocates and others and have been identified based on Lee Humphreys’ view on the original Pinch and Bijker SCOT theory. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with several stakeholders, and the transcriptions have been coded into themes to investigate what, according to these stakeholders, are the most valuable contributions and the largest risks of the chainless DGTL-drive now and in the future. This research explicates the most common and most remarkable results of these interviews and translates the individual responses to constructed group opinions. These value perceptions of social groups of stakeholders are the building blocks for advice on the strategic direction of the future of the Chainless DGTL-Drive to the management of Van Raam. In short, the interviewees were enthusiastic about the innovative drivetrain and acknowledged its potential, but most were able to identify some fears or downsides as well. Nevertheless, the more some of these stakeholders image the technology in use, the more enthusiastic they become, but they fear that all these possibilities come at a price. Making sure stakeholders experience the differences between the status quo and all that this drivetrain has to offer, while emphasising the benefits of the reduction in components, and therefore keeping maintenance costs low, will be crucial to the product's success.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Kamphuis, Robin",July 2025,English,"No

This study explores how Task Augmentation technologies (such as AI, Business Intelligence, and risk analysis tools) can reduce the cognitive limitations of Purchasers in a strategic-level context. Using Bounded Rationality theory as a part of Transaction Cost Economics, the study identifies common cognitive constraints such as satisficing, heuristic thinking, over-reliance on tacit knowledge that may be seen in Purchasing. With the selected level of analysis in Strategic Purchasing, including supplier selection and negotiation, this study examines effects encountered in real-life business scenarios. Thematic analysis based on a sample of 10 semi-structured interviews found that AI-supported or Internet-supported supplier identification, Business Intelligence tools integrated in ERP systems, and other tech applications were already in use in current day Purchasing practices. The findings suggest that the tools can assist in managing bounded rationality effects of purchasers, as they provide human users with data-driven insights. Furthermore, the study found usual barriers to I4.0 technology adoption, such as budget limitations, limited management support or lack of a business case in technology adoption.

Our study involving 13 participants aged 19-23 found that engagement with DMHIs is influenced by emotional, functional, and social factors. Key engagement strategies include personalized feedback, mood tracking, and community-based features, which support emotional insight, self-awareness, and routine-building. However, participants also expressed concerns about gamification mechanisms and unmoderated social features. Key engagement facilitators include visual feedback, customizable goal-setting activities, and alignment with users' daily routines. Barriers to sustained engagement included perceived pressure, emotional overload, and lack of control over AI-driven features. This study suggests a co-adaptive engagement model, where digital mental health tools adapt to users' needs and preferences over time, allowing them to personalize the intervention to their goals and emotional rhythms.

Findings indicate that professionals have three views towards AI, positive, negative and neutral. Professionals expressed worries of over-reliance and cognitive concerns. While simultaneously acknowledging how beneficial AI can be. They expressed that their professional identity which is closely linked to their values is at risk. However, they believe that if the AI implemented aligns with their professional values, they are likely to experience reinforced identities. Furthermore, they indicated the importance of AI literacy, training and up-skilling as important factors of preserving their job flourishing and thriving.

Using FinBERT, a finance-specific NLP model, sentiment scores were extracted from over 15,000 ECC transcripts of S&P 500 companies (2010-2018), analyzing Full Call, Presentation, and Q&A sections separately. These sentiment scores were matched with three-day cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) using market-adjusted event study methodology.
Results confirm that positive sentiment significantly predicts higher CAR across all three sections, with Full Call showing the strongest effect. The Q&A section demonstrates stronger individual effects than Presentation, suggesting investors respond more to unscripted communication. Sector-specific analysis reveals significant variation: Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary show stronger sentiment-return relationships, while Utilities and Energy exhibit minimal sensitivity.
This research contributes to behavioral finance and signaling theory by demonstrating that managerial tone serves as a credible signal beyond numerical financial data. The study offers practical insights for investors seeking short-term trading opportunities and companies aiming to optimize their communication strategies.

How effectively they manage this uncertainty can influence group performance, engagement, and learning outcomes, making individual traits such as self- regulation and the need for cognitive closure particularly relevant. This study examines how distinct self-regulation components and the need for closure relate to students’ use of four uncertainty management strategies during a collaborative design task. These strategies are reduce, maintain, increase, and ignore. Twenty-one university students participated in a problem-solving task using the Aladdin simulation platform. Their behaviours were coded based on Zimmerman’s self-regulated learning model and Jordan and McDaniel’s uncertainty management framework. Participants also completed the 15-item Need for Closure Scale. Results showed statistically significant positive correlations between the following self- regulation components: strategic planning, task strategy use, self-monitoring and uncertainty strategies, particularly maintain and increase. No significant associations were found between the need for closure and self-regulation behaviours. These findings suggest that highly self- regulated students adopt flexible and context-sensitive strategies to engage with uncertainty, rather than simply aiming to reduce it. Collaborative learning environments should support flexible uncertainty engagement by scaffolding self-regulation processes and accounting for individual differences in need for closure.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Schell, Lena",June 2025,English,"No

The review encompasses 13 studies across the business, healthcare, and public administration fields. It identified several themes contributing to effective resource orchestration and network outcomes. Based on the findings, a conceptual framework was developed, which clarifies not only how resources are allocated and managed by healthcare networks, but also emphasises that the synchronisation of resources, network actors, and inter-organisational actions is needed to achieve positive network outcomes.

uncertainty into the global markets. This research investigates the dynamics of 
sentiment expressed in earnings conference calls of S&P 500 companies during the 
COVID-19 pandemic and how it relates to stock performance. The importance of 
textual data in investor communication during extreme conditions is explored by 
focusing on three areas: differences in sentiment across the 11 S&P 500 sectors, 
sentiment changes over time and textual sentiment as a predictor of stock returns. A 
sentiment score was created using the Loughran-McDonald financial dictionary, 
extracting sentiment data from both the presentation and Q&A sections of earnings call 
transcripts from 2019 to 2023. Monthly stock returns were calculated and integrated 
with sentiment data of the S&P 500 and its sectors. Moreover, statistical tests were 
performed to examine sectoral sentiment variations, differences in sentiment between 
time periods and a correlation between sentiment and stock performance. Results show 
significant sectoral differences, with financials, real estate, utilities and materials 
expressing more negative sentiment during the pandemic. Sentiment also dropped 
sharply in the early phase of the pandemic (2020), but recovered and stabilized rapidly 
thereafter. However, no significant correlation was found between sentiment and next 
month’s return. These findings suggest that while earnings call sentiment reflects 
patterns across sectors and time, it does not provide a reliable predictive power for 
returns on a monthly basis. Nevertheless, this research presents opportunities for future

As AI is increasingly integrated into the workplace, its effects on how professionals relate to their work have become more significant but are still unclear. The study employs a qualitative approach, comprising seven semi-structured interviews with professionals from diverse fields who implement AI in their roles and jobs. Following Thematic Analysis and Gioia's methodology, the results of this thesis offer insight into how AI influences professional identity, autonomy, and engagement. The findings show two contrasting experiences. For some professionals, AI disrupted their sense of meaning, reduced autonomy, and challenged their identity, leading to emotional detachment. For others, AI enhanced their role, supported their values, and fostered a stronger connection to their work. These differences highlight that the impact of AI depends heavily on how it is implemented and how professionals perceive their agency over it.

answered ten multiple-choice questions focusing on common misconceptions about
generative artificial intelligence individually, then either discussed the question with a peer or
wrote a self-explanation about their answer and then answered the same question individually
again. Results of the first and second answers were used to calculate the normalised gains.

106832,The Future of Digital Retail: How do avatar-led branded experiences relate to users’ decisions to purchase virtual goods on Roblox?,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106832,"This thesis explores how avatar-led branded experiences on Roblox influence users’ purchasing behaviors. With
increasing immersion and sociability within virtual worlds, brands are making significant investments to create
gamified, avatar-led worlds. However, currently, little is known about what features of such branded experiences
affect users’ purchasing decisions. To contribute to this knowledge gap, this research employs a qualitative research
method that combines non-participant observations of three branded worlds, H&M Lootopia, Vans World, and ALO
Sanctuary, with two semi-structured interview sessions with two adult Roblox players.
The research determined four emerging themes that motivate consumer engagement with branded virtual clothing
and accessories: avatar customization as identity expression, psychological ownership and perceived value, social
influence and peer validation, and branded world engagement and experience quality. They were determined through
systematic thematic analysis and indicate that consumers are more likely to interact and buy digital goods when
these behaviors enable personal expression, emotional connection, and social alignment.
The results add to academic discussions on virtual consumer behavior and brand co-creation in metaverse
environments. Strategically, the research offers recommendations to marketers designing branded space in
immersive digital environments. The research suggests facilitating identity expression and symbolic value creation
through customization and establishing a sense of community and recognition. Finally, this study demonstrates that
branded metaverse spaces are not only promotional spaces, but also social ecosystems that foster more engagement
and influence purchasing intentions.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Abdrakhmanova, Adelia",June 2025,English,"No.

106829,Unveiling the Uncanny Valley: Investigating Reaction Time Dynamics in Human Perception through Changing Exposure Times of Highly Human-like Biological Faces,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106829,"The uncanny valley hypothesis proposes a non-linear relationship between a face’s human-likeness and its perceived likeability: as artificial agents become more humanlike, they are generally liked more until a threshold is crossed, after which small deviations from full humanness elicit a drop in likeability. This study examined whether this “valley” emerges under different visual exposure durations and whether reaction time increases when a stimulus lies in an individual’s likeability trough (valley) potentially indicating processing conflict or aversion. Bayesian polynomial regression was used to model the relationship between perceived human-likeness and both likeability and reaction time across exposure times.
Results showed a positive association between human-likeness and likeability across all exposure durations, with only weak curvature and no evidence for a clear “valley.” Reaction time models showed stronger non-linearity, with slower responses to moderately humanlike faces, especially at 200ms and 400ms. However, these RT peaks did not align with likeability minima, offering limited support for the idea that RT increases in the uncanny valley.
These findings suggest that while likeability may not exhibit a distinct uncanny valley in this context, reaction times may reflect subtle perceptual uncertainty.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Overkamp, S.",June 2025,English,"No

This study will try to explore how AI implementation changes the work of auditors, focusing on task allocation, cooperation with AI system, and accountability in audit decision-making. A qualitative research design was used, implementing semi-structured interviews with auditors who have experience with AI-based audit tools. The theoretical frameworks of human-AI teaming, sociotechnical systems, algorithmic accountability, and job crafting were applied to analyze the data. The findings reveal that AI automates routine audit tasks, shifting the responsibilities of auditors towards a more analytical, judgment based, and supervisory role. Successful implementation of AI requires auditors to develop new skill sets, including critical evaluation of AI outputs and improved technological literacy. Furthermore, accountability still will remain firm with human auditors, focusing on the need for transparency and professional judgement in AI assisted auditing processes.

The results reveal a broad spectrum of political communication which came often intertwined with humor and provocation. Some interactions contained disinformation, slurs, or ideological messages while others showed more sincere conversation on issues like abortion, immigration, or religion.

106824,How manufacturing leaders shape employee attitude towards AI adoption: A retrospective analysis from change management literature,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106824,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) constitutes the most recent advancement in Digital Transformation (DT), with growing prevalence across societal domains. Within the field of business, its unparalleled capabilities and implications are becoming more evident at a rapid pace. This development has generated employee concerns regarding job security and their ability to remain competitive in an AI-integrated workplace. This shift in ‘employee attitude’ has been proven to produce negative outcomes for organizations and people alike, though research indicates that employee attitudes toward technological change are malleable through targeted intervention. Organizational leaders have been shown to hold a certain influence over their subordinates’ cognitive and behavioral reactions in such periods of fundamental change. This research performs an analysis by meticulously following a systematic literature review (SLR) process, carefully selecting and analyzing twenty articles. By using a coding method, a well-documented shortcoming of the highly relevant Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was identified. Leveraging yet another theory on employee attitude, Solberg’s digital mindsets, and combining the two theories in a single model, led to a novel contribution to existing literature. By incorporating an additional leadership dimension, this study develops a four-quadrant framework aimed at proposing fitting leadership approaches for particular employee digital mindsets in face of technological change.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Schuppen, Q. van",June 2025,English,"No

106823,Systematic identification of opportunities to apply Artificial Intelligence to increase efficiency of business processes: a literature review and case study,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106823,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology attributed to have the potential to radically impact current business practices. The technology’s most reported business value is its ability to improve the efficiency of business processes (BPs) which it enables through automating or augmenting tasks. Organisations indicate to be interested in adoption, but struggle to realize the technology’s potential in practice. A specific identified problem is the lack understanding of where AI can be applied in organisations. Previous studies adopt Business Process Management (BPM) methodology to address this issue. This paper recognizes a shortcoming of this approach related to AI: BPM lacks adequate methodology to evaluate technology for implementation. Therefore, in order to provide a more robust and systematic method to evaluate BPs for AI implementation, the theoretical basis of this paper consists of BPM complemented with Task-Technology Fit (TTF) theory. TTF is used to match AI technologies with the type of task it can support. This study adopts a Design Science Research methodology to design an artifact, namely a five-step framework organisations can use to systematically identify opportunities to apply AI to increase efficiency of BPs. This framework is applied in practice in the form of a case study at a data consultancy start-up. There it was shown that the framework results in an overview of the tasks in the different BPs with the most suitable AI technology. This overview is evaluated to be useful in the process of identifying opportunities to apply AI. It was, however, also found that the framework relies on subjective judgement and does not result in concrete AI solutions but rather provides a basis, in the form of an overview, that supports identifying opportunities for AI technologies.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Schoeren, D.M.Q.",July 2025,English,"No

106822,Navigating Entrepreneurial Uncertainty: The Role of AI in Causal and Effectual Decision-Making in Early-Stage Ventures,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106822,"Entrepreneurs play a significant role in economic growth and innovation. Their ventures usually encounter 
challenges, such as uncertainty, a lack of experience, and a lack of resources. Adaptive decision-making is needed 
to operate effectively within a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environment. Entrepreneurs 
typically use either causation, a predictive and goal-oriented approach, or effectuation, which is adaptive and 
means-based. Effectuation works best in early-stage ventures that experience high uncertainty, leveraging 
available resources, strategic partnerships, and affordable-loss experimentation to find new opportunities. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing, game-changing technology for entrepreneurs, but its connection 
to entrepreneurial decision-making is underexplored. Particularly with causation and effectuation decision
making logic. This study is based on a mixed-method approach with survey data and semi-structured interviews. 
Results provide practical implications for entrepreneurs and theoretical contributions through the extension of 
effectuation theory with AI to leverage decision-making. AI supports entrepreneurs by improving idea generation, 
improving efficiency, and reducing uncertainty through predictive analytics. Findings reveal that AI in early
stage ventures helps with recognising opportunities, market analysis, and scenario building. AI shifts 
entrepreneurs toward a more hybrid decision-making approach, where AI tools introduce causal processes into 
effectuation, and at the same time, AI brings more adaptive, effectual characteristics to causation. AI allows for 
the co-existence and usability of both logics. Unfortunately, leveraging AI comes with challenges: e.g., 
sustainability issues, privacy of data, poor quality results, and distrust among users. Entrepreneurs can partly 
overcome these challenges by increasing knowledge about AI and checking AI output, rather than blindly trusting 
it. This study examines ways in which entrepreneurs use AI to leverage decision-making across venture lifecycles. 
Additionally, AI’s role in transitioning decision-making, changes in AI use across startup phases, and AI 
challenges are discussed.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Jager, C.D. de",July 2025,English,"No.

This disparity underscores the need for prosthetic solutions that are not only affordable and functionally effective but also adaptable to users' diverse needs. Amputees continue to face physical, psychological, and social challenges that impact their quality of life on a daily basis. In response to this need, Gyromotics introduced the Nova foot, a dynamic, high-performance, and cost-effective prosthetic foot designed for active lower-limb amputees (K2–K4), including both adults and children. However, a key limitation persists: the absence of an adjustable ankle joint. This constraint increases socket pressure, reduces terrain adaptability, and limits compatibility with varied footwear.
This thesis proposes a modular design framework for an adjustable ankle mechanism that enables users to modify sagittal plane positioning manually. The framework supports integration into Gyromotics’ product portfolio while addressing market strategy, team structure, scalability, lifecycle, and portfolio management. Applied to the Nova foot, it emphasizes user-centred functionality and compliance with MDR and ISO standards.

Despite their potential, sustaining user engagement with DMHIs remains a critical challenge. This qualitative study design, consisting of three separate focus groups with 13 participants aged 19–23, investigates the role of human support as an engagement strategy in DMHIs. The thematic analysis revealed that human support is perceived to improve engagement by making interventions feel more personal and emotionally supportive. Benefits included improved accessibility, emotional connection, and an improved mental state. However, concerns about the authenticity of digital support, technical disruptions, and privacy issues were also mentioned. Participants expressed a preference for consistent, flexible, and personalised human support, such as regular check-ins, unscheduled calls, and same-person support.

multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) without compromising assumptions of fairness. Line managers in contemporary
team-working workplaces must respond to the needs of individuals with normal, equal treatment. This research
investigates three MDTs in two organizations in Kyrgyzstan, drawing on seven semi-structured interviews with line
managers and employees.
From thematic analysis, four over-arching themes were identified: HRM Differentiation Strategies, Justification and
Communication, Fairness Perceptions, and the Evolving Role of the Line Manager. The findings show that
differentiated HRM-i.e., special support, training, or rewards-is common and widely accepted if perceived as fair.
Workers did not expect to be treated equally but welcomed proportionality and situational suitability.
Communication that was respectful and open was discovered to be a key motivation for legitimizing differentiated
decisions and maintaining trust.
The study contributes to the theory of HRM by emphasizing the importance of interactional justice in teams, where
not just outcomes but also explanations and delivery of decisions contribute to determining fairness. The study also
offers empirical support for the fairness-consistency paradox in that it illustrates how managers reconcile the tension
between flexibility and impartiality. Practically, the research suggests that effective differentiation in HRM requires
situational awareness, emotional intelligence, and good communication skills. These implications guide the

strategies without AI support, and their metacognitive strategies in interactions with AI. Thirty
participants (N = 30), recruited through a convenience sample, completed the study in the online

while quantitative analysis measured differences in Metacognitive Awareness. The key findings
were that Monitoring was the most frequently used strategy in both conditions, a slight decrease
in overall strategy frequency was observed with Clair and a significant increase in Planning
awareness post-intervention was found via the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory. This
research did not find sufficient evidence to support Clair’s impact as a teaching support tool, as

It draws on signalling theory, social-capital theory and two-sided-market theory as a conceptual foundation. The analysis uses data from 739 campaigns across 12 major crowdfunding platforms; all launched between June 2023 and May 2025. A novel index-based framework categorizes platform design into four dimensions: Visibility & Promotion (VP), Trust & Quality Control (TQC), Interaction & Virality (IV), and Accessibility & Friction (AF). The empirical strategy applies cluster-robust logistic regression to estimate the relationship between platform features and campaign success, controlling for key campaign characteristics. The study finds that campaign fundamentals dominate and platform indexes provide mixed effects. The VP and IV indexes have a mild positive effect which is not statistically significant while the TQC and AF indexes are negatively associated with funding success and are statistically significant. This could indicate adverse self-selection, meaning that riskier, capital-intensive projects are attracted by these platforms and drive down success rates.

106810,Augmented Purchasing : Enhancing Reactive Risk Management in Procurement,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106810,"In a supply chain that is global and complex, purchasers face vast amounts of data. As human decision-makers are bounded by their limited rationality, this leads to suboptimal responses in reactive risk management. As digitalisation advances, the collaboration between humans and machines, i.e. augmentation, can overcome bounded rationality. This study focuses on how augmentation can improve reactive risk management through overcoming bounded rationality. The findings show that augmentation supports more rational and more timely decision making by enabling forecasting & pattern recognition, less human actions, planning, tracking & mapping, and visualisation. However, the effectiveness of augmentation’s effect on overcoming bounded rationality depends on the quality, uniformity and completeness of data. Moreover, purchaser skills tend to change to make effective use of augmentation possibilities. This emphasises a hybrid set of skills such as computer literacy, analytical thinking, data management, negotiation, system thinking and supplier relationship management. This study adds to the transaction cost economic theory by showing how augmentation can overcome bounded rationality. It extends reactive risk management frameworks by integrating augmentation as a tool through the risk management process steps.

Using a quantitative survey approach, the responses of 44 SME owners and financial managers were analysed. The results show that rising interest rates significantly increase a firm’s likelihood of choosing debt-based crowdfunding over bank loans, with a switching threshold lying between 5% and 8%. Stable GDP growth, on the other hand, increases the likelihood of choosing bank loans. Furthermore, exposure to these factors is influenced by firm-specific characteristics, especially firm age and size. Smaller and younger enterprises were found to be more likely to change their financing approach from bank loans to lending-based crowdfunding when borrowing rates increase. In contrast, larger and older firms tend to have a higher threshold for such shifts.

Businesses use new technologies to automate many of their business practices. Implementing new technologies can have many benefits for organisations. Though, these new technologies also have their own challenges when it comes to their implementations. This study investigates the challenges that come with implementing new technologies. Next to this, it is investigated which skills are important to manage the new systems. The study followed a qualitative research approach, combining the interviews that were held with six purchasing professionals to identify the most important new technologies, their respective challenges and the skills that have become more or less relevant as a result of the new innovations.

One way to deal with these pressures, is by sharing machinery between departments. There is lack of research on intra-organizational machine sharing within service-providing organizations. This research aims to contribute theoretically by identifying potential impacts of sharing in contrast to owning medical devices on operational efficiency and quality of service. This is done through a case study of a hospital in the region Twente in the Netherlands. Twelve in-depth interviews were done with a multi-disciplinary sample to gather subjective experiences on the processes related to the usage of an ultrasound device. The interview analysis is supported by an analysis of time measurements and financials. This resulted in an overview showing how operational efficiency and quality of service are impacted through sharing and owning a device. This research also aims to contribute to practice by supporting hospital departments who are facing a decision of sharing or owning medical devices.

106800,Augmented Decision Making in Purchasing and Supply Management (PSM) : Overcoming Bounded Rationality,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106800,"This thesis explores how digital technologies, including those associated with Industry 4.0, can 
enhance human expertise in proactive risk management within Procurement and Supply 
Management (PSM). Based on an extensive literature review and qualitative interviews with 
professionals from eight organisations, the study examines how tools like Artificial Intelligence 
(AI), Big Data Analytics (BDA), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, and Digital Twins 
support human decision making. The findings show that effective augmentation goes beyond 
automating routine tasks. Digital technologies help overcome bounded rationality and improve risk 
identification and assessment. However, these tools are most effective when combined with human 
judgment. Thanks to this “digitalisation,” PSM roles are shifting more from operational and 
transactional tasks to strategic and collaborative functions. This evolution requires professionals to 
develop new capabilities in digital literacy, data management, systems thinking, and analytical 
reasoning. While traditional skills like negotiation remain important, they are now applied in more 
data driven and relational ways. For managers, the study recommends investing not just in 
technologies but also in employees and data driven decision support. Building a model where 
technology enhances rather than replaces human input is key to effective proactive risk 
management. Limitations of the thesis include the study’s small, purposive sample and qualitative 
approach, which may limit the generalisability of the findings. Future research should examine 
evolving risk management skills in an augmented PSM environment, the ethical dimensions of AI

106799,The relationship between resource scarcity and the implementation of circular supply chain practices,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106799,"Resource scarcity is identified as a factor contributing to disruptions in the supply chain. Multiple different strategies to manage negative effects have been proposed over the years. An emerging approach is the concept of the circular supply chain, which can provide profitable results. Both topics have been researched individually, and a concrete relationship has not yet been identified. This thesis provides new information about how resource scarcity leads to circular supply chain implementation alongside the barriers that hinder changes. Through interviews with supply chain professionals, data was collected. The analysis of the results showed that resource scarcity does not have a significant impact on the implementation of circular supply chains. The losses and risks created by scarcity are inadequate to demand instant change. Traditional mitigation strategies, such as building safety stock and finding new suppliers, currently prevail in handling scarcity events, although they can be ineffective in the long term. Due to the lack of urgency, companies opt for a gradual transition to implement circular elements, which is often pushed by new directives and laws. The findings highlight a gap between awareness and action, suggesting that resource scarcity alone is insufficient to enact change within the supply chain.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Kooi, Tijn",July 2025,English,"No.

106798,Evaluating existing circular business models : a systematic literature review,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106798,"Purpose – Governments and society demand from businesses higher and higher sustainability efforts, but linear business models struggle to keep up. Because of this circular business models are becoming more popular. However the goals and methods of these circular business models are significantly different from linear business models, which makes the evaluation of circular business models difficult. So, this research paper analyzes the aims and methods of circular business models and draws a conclusion on how they should be evaluated based on them.
Design/methodology/approach – A systematic literature review was conducted with a final dataset of 29 documents that underwent a full-text review. A literature table was maintained to extract valuable information for the synthesis and a survey was created for validation purposes.
Findings – This research paper shows the importance for CBMs to create not only economic but also environmental value, which in the end leads to the conclusion that not only the value capture capabilities but also the value propositions and value creation & delivery methods of circular business models need to be inspected when evaluating circular business models. Furthermore, lifecycle profit, circularity metrics and life cycle assessment are showcased as appropriate valuation methods for circular business models.
Theoretical and practical implications – This research paper contributes to the theory by bringing together knowledge about circular business models and concluding on an appropriate valuation approach. The practical implications of this are that owners, managers and investors of circular business models will receive information that is adjusted to the goals and methods of circular business models.
Research limitations/implications – The major limitation of this systematic literature review is that due to time constraints strict inclusion & exclusion criteria had to be applied and more articles could not have been reviewed.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Maier, Bogdan",June 2025,English,"No

The research is situated in the real-world context of rotator cuff tear rehabilitation, a domain in which exercise adherence is essential but often inconsistent. Drawing on relevant theoretical models, a concept was designed, developed, and evaluated in real-world context. The prototype takes the form of a toothbrush holder that locks a toothbrush in place on designated exercise days until a user completes their prescribed exercises, an example of a hard-friction commitment device.
A week-long field study (n = 9) involving multiple experimental conditions revealed that the prototype significantly improved perceived self-efficacy for two of the six participants who used it. These results suggest that such an intervention could enhance long-term adherence. However, the study also identified several limitations of the commitment-based approach, highlighting the need for further long-term evaluation.

This study investigates the negotiation process between Dutch and Japanese companies, particularly focusing on how Dutch businesses can adapt their strategies to negotiate more effectively with Japanese firms. Through the use of semi-structured interviews with Dutch negotiators, this study identifies six key elements that are essential for successful negotiations in Japan: focus on details, respect, harmony, hierarchy, loyalty, and the challenges of translation. The study finds that Japanese companies emphasize long-term relationships, product quality, indirect communication, detailed discussions, seniority, collective decision-making, and high standards for preparation. It further highlights the need for Dutch companies to adapt to these Japanese business standards to avoid cultural friction that could harm negotiations. This research largely supports current literature on cross-cultural behavior, but also highlights the limitations of Hofstede’s dimensions in explaining observed real-life behavior.

Employees now face an invisible challenge, as they have to decide whether it is safe to speak up or if they prefer to remain silent. This bachelor thesis investigates the basis of this decision and shows, trough qualitative interviews, that psychological safety in hybrid meetings is not a constant characteristic but a subjective and situation-dependent experience. Employees only speak when they feel respected, recognised and included. Structural factors such as technical equipment or leadership both contribute to this, but are not necessarily decisive. The study highlights that hybrid communication reshapes conditions of trust, visibility and belonging and that psychological safety cannot be prescribed, but must be actively shaped.

106788,Beyond Automation : Transforming Strategic Sourcing Decisions Through Industry 4.0 Technologies,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106788,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution plays a transformative role in the way procurement
decisions are made. In the past, procurement professionals based their decisions on personal judgement, non-integrated systems and data in spreadsheets. Nowadays as digitalisation progresses, purchasing managers are exposed to increasing amounts of data analytics, complex information and global supply networks. Industry 4.0 brings in technologies such as business intelligence, ERP systems and AI that reshape information management as well as decision-making in strategic sourcing processes. In the context of this transformation lies the concept of task augmentation, whereby digital technologies are used to enhance, rather than replace, human task performance. Despite these tools enabling decision makers to reduce cognitive overload, integrate extensive data and consider many variables, their use remains rather limited in strategic decisions. To explore how task augmentation affects the ways procurement managers deal with increased data exposure, a qualitative study using ten semi-structured interviews with purchasing professionals was conducted. The findings show that whilst digital tools facilitate data-driven decision-making, the decision makers’ role extends towards tasks such as validating AI output and applying effective AI prompting strategies. This study furthers the understanding of bounded rationality in context of digitalisation, where technologies can be used to enhance human decision-making capacities in strategic sourcing by promoting objectiveness, data visualisation and extensive decision-making criteria.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Zavolokova, Polina",June 2025,English,"No.

One possible explanation lies in cognitive biases. These automatic, unconscious distortions that can negatively influence decision-making and attitudes can be altered by Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM). This study aimed to investigate whether CBM can reduce negative cognitive bias toward physical activity, and whether depressive symptoms, which are often associated with lower motivation,  play a role in bias levels or the intervention's effectiveness.
A single-group pre–post experimental design consisting of nineteen participants completed a pre-to-post intervention using the Single Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT), the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the TIIM app for CBM training. Data were analysed using paired t-tests, Spearman correlations, and linear mixed-effects models to evaluate changes in implicit attitudes and potential moderation by depressive symptoms. 
The findings indicated that participants’ implicit attitudes toward physical activity significantly improved (p < .001) after completing the CBM training, with a large effect size (Cohen’s d = –1.19). The relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive bias against physical activity was only marginally significant (p = .068). Furthermore, depressive symptoms did not significantly influence the effectiveness of the CBM training on bias over time (interaction p = .65). 
This study demonstrated that the CBM training was effective in reducing negative cognitive bias toward physical activity.

Many studies analyse gender inequality and women’s entrepreneurship, but often look at these subjects separately from one another. This study will explore whether women are more likely to start their businesses in sectors with a larger pay gap, using the gender pay gap as the independent variable and the percentage of women-owned businesses in each industry as the dependent variable. The goal of the research is to determine whether industries with a significant pay inequality also experience a higher rate of women transitioning to entrepreneurship. The results are analysed through correlation and regression analysis based on the data available. This research looks at different industries to see if pay gaps play a role in women’s decisions to leave regular jobs and become self-employed.

106783,Beyond the Credit Score : The Role of Social Capital in Microfinance Lending Decisions,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106783,"This study explores the extent to which social capital – a form of soft information – influences loan approval decisions across different credit score categories at a Dutch microfinance institution. The reliance on standardized hard information – such as credit scores – has reduced access to financing for those who lack a record of successfully repaying loans, particularly impacting SMEs.
Using a dataset of over 14,000 loan applications from 2018 to 2022, we developed a dictionary-based pattern recognition model to detect indicators of social capital within unstructured loan officer reports. The findings reveal that social capital consistently increases the likelihood of loan approval across all credit score categories. However, the overall effect of social capital did not significantly differ between credit score categories. Additionally, gender did not have an influence on the relationship between social capital and loan approval. Remarkably, credit scores alone did not significantly predict loan approval outcomes. This indicates that loan officers at this microfinance consistently rely more heavily on social capital than on credit scores when assessing the applicant’s creditworthiness. Therefore, this study highlights the impact of human judgement in microfinance lending.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Klaver, Siemen",June 2025,English,"No

companies, firms need to take them into account when making decisions. A timely example that highlights the importance of considering geopolitical risks is U.S. President Donald Trump’s increase in tariffs, which has a significant impact on its trading its partners, such as China. This research examines the impact of geopolitical risks on financial decision-making by investigating how geopolitical risks influence firms' leverage. The research uses a quantitative approach by performing a regression analysis with a sample of 520 US-based firms over the last decade, a period 
characterized by a global pandemic, trade conflicts and regional wars. The results indicate that geopolitical risk has no statistically significant effect on the leverage of 
firms. Furthermore, this study shows that industry is a key determinant that influences capital structure decisions of firms. Companies operating in the U.S. do not restructure 
their capital structure in response to geopolitical risk but rather use other adjustments. This study demonstrates that geopolitical risks’ influence on leverage may be overstated

106781,The effect of integrating micro- and macro-level indicators on the performance of Early Warning Systems for systemic banking crises: A literature review,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106781,"The underestimation of systemic risk due to inadequate risk prediction obstructed effec-tive risk management during historical financial crises. In response, Early Warning Sys-tems (EWSs) emerged to provide timely warnings and support decision-making. And while EWSs have become essential tools for anticipating financial instabilities, models focus on either bank-specific or macroeconomic events, rather than in combination. This limits their ability to capture the complex nature of systemic risk, as was seen during previous crises. To address this gap, this study investigated how integrating micro- and macro-level indicators affects the predictive performance of EWSs for systemic banking crises. To do so, a structured literature review covering 72 publications was conducted, of which 38 in-cluded models where quantitative performance comparison was possible. Building on ex-isting literature, this study contributes by going beyond model techniques and examines how performance is affected by three separate levels of indicators: micro, macro, and those two combined. The study finds that integrated models outperform macro-level mod-els in predicting systemic banking crises, with 19% higher recall and 8% lower miss rates. Compared to micro-level models, which focus on more frequent firm-level events, inte-grated models perform similarly, just 4% lower in recall and 5% higher in miss rate. The strong performance of integrated EWSs demonstrates the added value of combining mi-cro- and macro-level indicators and reinforces their importance in capturing the complex nature of systemic events.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Remoortere, Esmee van",June 2025,English,"No.

While prior research studied employee activism as isolated events, how these movements evolve over time and interact dynamically with corporate response is still underexplored. The present thesis aims to address this gap by analysing the longitudinal interaction between employee activism and corporate response, using Amazon as a case study. Focusing on Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, events from 2018 till late 2024 will be traced. Using a qualitative case study approach and implementing the Gioia methodology, 101 media articles were dissected and coded to map cyclical patterns of activism and response. The findings reflect a dynamic feedback loop, where employee activism progresses from internal mobilization to public protests and media engagement, while Amazon’s response cycles between defensive framing, symbolic or partially substantive concessions and retaliation. These interactions are then further shaped by external actors, such as the media, NGOs and regulators. This thesis provides an empirically grounded processual framework to better understand employee activism and corporate response interactions over time, providing practical insights for both activists and organizations, as well as policymakers, to navigate climate accountability within large corporations.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Suciu, Sonia-Maria",June 2025,English,"No

Predicting cyclist trajectories could prevent accidents by sharing them with surrounding traffic for timely warnings and interventions. This paper introduces two custom lightweight multi-modal models for cyclist trajectory prediction: BicycleNet, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), and a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (CNN-LSTM) model. The models are evaluated on unseen cyclists and new locations using two large, realistic datasets comprising sensor data from 63 participants, including four inertial measurement units (IMUs) mounted on the helmet, handlebar, frame, and pedal, as well as GPS and a forward-facing camera. BicycleNet achieves an average distance error of 1.86 m and a final distance error of 3.50 m over a prediction horizon of 5 seconds. Both models achieved similar prediction accuracy, while BicycleNet uses 3.5× fewer parameters than the CNN-LSTM. To determine an optimal sensing configuration, an analysis into sensing modality and IMU placement was carried out, which revealed that the best single IMU placement is on the pedal, closely followed by the frame and handlebar, while the helmet performed worst. Combining all four IMUs with GPS provides the best overall performance.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Smit, G. de",June 2025,English,"No.

106773,Enabling value creation from Enterprise Architecture : Supporting the grid operator in facilitating the energy transition,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106773,"This research explores how Enterprise Architecture (EA) can support Distribution System Operators (DSOs) in managing the challenges of the energy transition. As DSOs face growing electricity grid congestion due to increased renewable energy integration and electrification, they must develop new capabilities, particularly around increasing the flexibility in the grid. However, EA is not supporting the development of the flexibility products, preventing the DSO to rapidly increase the grid utilization. Moreover, the DSO is unsure how EA value creation can be ensured. This study presents an EA benefit realization framework that can be used to ensure EA value creation and assess EA performance. An EA process model was designed to allow EA value creation in every level of the DSO organization, increasing the EA benefits. The application of these artifacts  allows EA to support the development of flexibility products, which was proven by designing an appropriate EA vision artifact. These tools align EA artifacts with organizational benefits and help guide flexibility product development. Validation through expert interviews confirmed their relevance and refined their design.",Master Business Information Technology (M-BIT),"Berkenbosch, T.R.",June 2025,English,"No

The specific focus lies on the role of regional gender pay gaps and childcare accessibility. Hierarchical regression models investigate with the use of cross-sectional data from 2018 to 2023 how disparities in the gender pay gap impact rates of female entrepreneurship. While childcare accessibility is considered as a moderating institutional factor. Control variables in the analysis are population density, female population share and regional political orientation. The results indicate that higher gender pay gaps have a positive relationship with increased female self-employment, which suggests that the gender pay gap may motivate women to pursue entrepreneurship as an alternative career path to traditional employment. However, this relationship weakens in areas with better accessible childcare, which highlights the essence of institutional support in influencing women’s entrepreneurial pathways.

These emotions often arise from a perceived inability to adapt to the consequences of climate change. This scoping review aimed to identify and interpret risk and protective factors associated with eco-anxiety. Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, 825 studies were screened using ASReview's machine learning capabilities and full-text screening in Covidence. Eligible studies addressed eco-anxiety, reported risk or protective factors, and were peer-reviewed articles published in English, Dutch, German, or Spanish.

Female participants were overrepresented (k = 24), and most studies originated from the Global North (k = 33). Younger individuals and women were identified as vulnerable groups. Protective factors included flexible coping strategies such as social support, emotional regulation, normalising emotions, and perspective-taking. Media exposure, climate-related education, and climate activism showed mixed effects depending on the context.

Through an analysis of two high-risk subcategories, tabletop games and high-tech gadgets, this study intends to identify characteristics that indicate campaign fraud. The independent variables, minimum reward, campaign duration, word count, spelling error percentage, and sentiment score, are investigated. We manually verified 348 campaigns to conduct an analysis to determine whether they could be fraudulent. These campaigns were selected on the criterion that they did not enter the public market. To determine whether a crowdfunding campaign is considered fraud, five criteria are created. When at least three out of five criteria are met, the campaign is considered to be fraudulent. This research contributes to theory in the crowdfunding field by addressing how fraud connects to observable campaign characteristics. Crowdfunding platforms, backers, and campaign creators can benefit from this model by identifying suspicious and fraudulent behaviour.

Besides academics and social life, one aspect that is often overlooked in this population is the perceived effort required to perform activities of daily living (ADL). The ability to carry out these ADL is essential for independence and well-being during the transition into adulthood. This study explored the relationship between depressive symptoms and perceived effort in ADL tasks, mediated by hopelessness in young adults between 18 and 29 years old. This was done by a cross-sectional design using a questionnaire including Beck’s depression inventory, Beck’s hopelessness scale, and the newly constructed ADL effort scale, which consisted of four subscales: basic ADL, household tasks, meal preparation, and social and engagement tasks. The results show that there was a significant direct relationship between the three main variables of depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and ADL effort. Although the overall mediating role of hopelessness was not statistically significant in general ADL tasks, it was found to be significant in the subscale household tasks. These findings suggest that underlying psychological factors such as hopelessness can play a role in the perceived burdensome of ADL tasks among young adults experiencing depressive symptoms.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Tempelaar, Jacobine",June 2025,English,"No

The Impact of Anthropomorphic Design Features on Emotions and Learning",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106765,"This study examines how emotional responses, memory retention, and perceived task difficulty are affected by facial anthropomorphic design elements in static learning materials. The study investigates whether anthropomorphic features, like eyes and mouths, can improve students' emotional engagement and cognitive functioning in context with the growing interest in emotional design in education. A total of 64 university students were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: text-only, non-anthropomorphic images, and anthropomorphic images. A multiple-choice test was used to measure memory retention, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) was used to evaluate emotional responses. Participants also indicated their perceived difficulty of the task. The findings showed that there was no significant difference in emotional responses of the different experimental groups. Furthermore, it was found that, while task difficulty was a significant predictor of memory retention, the presence of anthropomorphic design features did not significantly impact retention scores. These findings suggest that the design of the study did not allow for a significant effect of anthropomorphism to be assessed. The study contributes to the ongoing debate on emotional design, emphasising the need for further research into the effects of anthropomorphism in an educational setting.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Elster, Zoë",June 2025,English,"No

Using manually collected data from Kickstarter (reward-based) and Crowdcube (equity-based) for technology-based campaigns launched between March and May 2025, the study analyzes early investor numbers, early funding amounts, and the percentage of the funding goal achieved early in the campaign. 
The results indicate that equity-based campaigns attract larger early investments and achieve higher total funding. In contrast, reward-based campaigns often reach a greater percentage of their funding goal in the early stages, but with more variability. Regression and t-test analyses confirm that early investment is a significant predictor of campaign success, especially for equity-based campaigns. Correlation analysis reveals a strong bandwagon effect, where early momentum attracts more investors and increases the likelihood of success. 
These findings demonstrate that early investors play a critical role in both crowdfunding models, with a stronger and more consistent influence observed in equity-based campaigns.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Wösting, Sam",July 2025,English,"No

106762,Beyond Pressure: How Compassion Can Impact Well-Being and Attitudes Towards Activities of Daily Living,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106762,"Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), such as cleaning or cooking, are the invisible responsibilities that keep life going and enable individuals to participate in daily and social life. These tasks are often accompanied by societal pressure linking their completion to personal worth. In Western societies, social media trends like the Clean Girl aesthetic reinforce these standards by promoting idealized, effortless routines, especially among young women. In contrast, compassion-based approaches, such as Davis´s approach Care Tasks are Morally Neutral, aim to reduce shame around ADLs by reframing them without moral value. This study examined whether exposure to Davis’s compassion-based approach Care Tasks are Morally Neutral would lower perceived stress (PSS), improve positive mental health (PMH), and foster a more positive attitude towards ADLs among young adults. An exploratory analysis investigated whether higher Clean Girl content consumption was correlated with greater perceived stress in female participants. A randomized, controlled design was conducted (N = 59; aged 17-26), with participants recruited via a university platform (SONA), social media, and word-of-mouth. The experimental group (N = 30) received a short, video-based intervention over three days and the control group (N = 29) received no intervention. PSS, PMH and ADL attitudes were assessed using standardized and custom measures. Contrary to expectations, no significant differences were found between groups over time. No significant correlation was detected between Clean Girl trend consumption and perceived stress scores. There are several possible explanations for these findings, including the brief duration of the intervention, the small sample size, or the lack of interaction or reflection to ensure the participant´s attention.

Although the popularity of crowdfunding has increased, we identified that existing literature focuses primarily on the outcomes of crowdfunding campaigns, rather than on the decision-making process that precedes them. Particularly, the choice between reward-based, equity-based, and lending-based crowdfunding models. This thesis looks at what motivates entrepreneurs to select a specific crowdfunding model, focusing on the precampaign phase.  Qualitative research in the form of 10 semi-structured interviews has been conducted. The participants included are entrepreneurs, experts, and investors. In order to analyze the data from the interviews, the thematic analysis from Bruan & Clarke (2006) will be used. The five core themes are: Motivations behind crowdfunding, model choice and decision-making, trust and public perception, contextual factors, and reflections & lessons. The findings reveal that entrepreneurs view crowdfunding as more than just a financing tool. But also perceive it as a strategic step to validate ideas, build a customer base, and increase market visibility. Model selection is shaped by a combination of strategic, contextual, and reputational factors. Some entrepreneurs even rejected crowdfunding a concern that it reputation damage. These insights show that model choice is not made in isolation, but the result of a broader alignment of entrepreneurial behaviour in early-stage financing and highlight the importance of tailored guidance in the model selection process.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Aslan, Ephrem",June 2025,English,"No.

The study further analyzes whether openness to change acts as a moderator in these relationships. Data is collected from 150 employees across multiple organizations with a structured online survey. Quantitative analyses are conducted to test the hypotheses. Results show that perceived negative affect-based responses from leaders reduce employee change readiness, especially in terms of appropriateness, change efficacy, and personal valence.

This thesis explores how value-based segmentation shapes relationship management strategies within B2B companies. By combining theoretical frameworks with qualitative data from 31 expert interviews across diverse industries, this research reveals that most firms actively differentiate their customer treatment based on value segmentation, using models such as RFM, macro-micro segmentation, and customer lifetime value (CLV). High-value clients typically receive preferential treatment such as personalized communication, pricing advantages, and operational flexibility, while baseline service levels are maintained for lower-tier customers. The findings show that value segmentation not only enhances CRM efficiency and customer satisfaction but also drives company performance through optimized resource allocation and strategic alignment. This research bridges a gap in the literature by integrating customer value into practical CRM applications and offers actionable insights for managers seeking to optimize their customer-centric strategies in B2B environments.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Krugten, T.M. van",June 2025,English,"No

A crucial part of crisis negotiations is to build trust and eventually influence the PiC to change their behaviour in order to come to a peaceful solution. While self-disclosure is mentioned as an active listening skill, which form the foundation of crisis negotiations, its effectiveness has not previously been researched. In this quantitative, between-subjects study, 50 participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: either no negotiator self-disclosure or moderate negotiator self-disclosure. Contrary to expectations, self-disclosure had no significant effect on perceived trust. Rapport, on the other hand, was found to be a significant positive predictor. Furthermore, no moderating effect of rapport on the relationship between self-disclosure and trust was observed. These results suggest that self-disclosure alone may not be sufficient for establishing trust, while maintaining rapport remains an important factor. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of active listening skills.

By running on cross-sectional dataset of 1280 UK based firms, this analysis analyzes the relationships between structural, occupational and socio-economic variables, specifically share of female executives, share of women on boards, gender diversity among executives, company size, firm registration as a Public Limited Company and average board member age, influence the mean hourly gender pay. By running a multiple linear regression, it is shown that higher proportion of female representation in leadership roles is significantly associated with smaller gender pay gaps. Public Limited Companies tend to create larger gaps, while firms with older boards tend to be associated with lower gender pay gaps. These findings suggest that including women in leadership roles may be the key to addressing wage inequality. However, the model only explains a small portion of these variances (adjusted r2 = 0.0205). This may be an indicator that other unmeasurable factors such as, gender-role expectations and part-time work status could play an important role.

106749,Material Passports for a Circular Built Environment : Bridging Theory and Practice on Adoption Drivers and Barriers,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106749,"The construction industry is a major contributor to global CO₂ emissions and resource consumption, yet its transition to circularity remains limited. Material Passports (MPs)—digital tools that provide structured data on the sustainability and circularity of building materials—are emerging as key enablers of a Circular Economy (CE). This thesis investigates the practical adoption of MPs across the construction lifecycle by identifying stakeholder-specific drivers and barriers. Using a mixed-methods approach, including interviews and a two-round Delphi study with stakeholders in Germany, the study applies a PEST (Political, Economic, Social, Technological) framework to assess adoption dynamics. Results reveal significant discrepancies in MP readiness: manufacturing and material sourcing stages show high openness, while planning and operation stages face considerable resistance due to regulatory gaps, cost concerns, and workflow incompatibilities. The study finds that MP adoption is not a plug-and-play solution but requires tailored, stakeholder-specific pathways and regulatory standardization. By contributing a lifecycle-stage-specific perspective on adoption, this research supports both academic understanding and the strategic development of MPs.

106748,The Influence of Linguistic Framing on the Perception of Femicide,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106748,"This study examines how linguistic framing in news articles influences public perception of femicide. In a between-subjects experiment with 152 participants, the same event was presented using either trivializing or explicit language. Participants then rated perceived crime severity, perpetrator blame, and recognition of femicide as a systemic issue. Results showed that explicit framing led to higher perceived severity and greater recognition of structural violence, though it did not significantly affect blame attribution. Hostile sexism emerged as a negative predictor across all outcomes. Importantly, the framing effect remained significant even after controlling for hostile sexism, highlighting the independent power of language. These findings underscore the media’s role in shaping public understanding of gender-based violence and advocate for more accurate, responsible reporting to foster awareness and prevention.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Schmidt, Paula",June 2025,English,"No

106743,Uncovering the Hidden Barriers to Exercise: The Role of Implicit Bias and Cognitive Bias Modification in Overcoming the Rationalisation of Lack of Time,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106743,"Despite the widespread knowledge of the health benefits of 	Physical Activity (PA), many individuals remain inactive, often rationalising this with a lack of time. The Affective-Reflective Theory (ART) posits that automatic, affective processes, closely aligned with implicit attitudes, may drive behaviour, suggesting that negative implicit attitudes toward PA could underlie the Rationalisation of Lack of Time (RLoT). Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) has shown promising results in modifying implicit attitudes, but its effectiveness in the context of PA remains underexplored. This study aimed to examine whether individuals who rationalise a lack of time have more negative implicit attitudes toward PA, and whether CBM can reduce these attitudes, particularly for those with such rationalisations.The findings indicate that CBM can effectively improve positive implicit attitudes toward PA. However, the study found no evidence supporting the moderating role of RLoT.

Four variables were constructed based on an age-friendly workplace framework by Appannah and Biggs (2015, p. 47): anti-discrimination policies, flexible work arrangements, training and development, and job-role alignment. Using survey data of the EXPERTISE project, a split-sample multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate the effects of the organizational factors on perceived age discrimination and how these perceptions differ between silver workers and non-silver workers. 
In the findings there is a clear distinction of perception: non-silver workers believe anti-discrimination policies to mitigate age discrimination whilst silver workers believe tangible factors like flexible work arrangements and training opportunities have that effect. These results highlight the presence of an implementation gap. Policies might exist but are not perceived as effective by silver workers. 
This study contributes to literature by quantitatively supporting parts of the age-friendly workplace framework and highlighting the role of the implementation gap in this issue. Practically, this implementation gap should be addressed by organizations. They can do so by investing in inclusive HR practices to address the expectations of both age groups, mitigating perceived age discrimination and creating an age-friendlier workplace.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Groenewoud, R.S.",July 2025,English,"No

The workshop, held in a forest near the University of Twente, engaged six university students in sensory and perspective-taking exercises designed to encourage emotional, rather than purely cognitive, connections with the natural world. The diary study included two daily questionnaires across one week. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data, resulting in four key themes: emotional connection to nature, sense of responsibility, behavioral or cognitive change, and personal reflections. While most participants reported increased attentiveness to their surroundings and a stronger desire to spend time in nature, fewer expressed deep emotional engagement or significant behavioral shifts. The findings suggest that the workshop’s impact was influenced by participants’ openness to imagination-based methods.

This thesis examines how victims respond to the first ransom demand, focusing not just on what they say, but how they navigate the uncertainty, pressure, and power imbalance of the situation. Analyzing 134 negotiation transcripts, the study identifies eleven distinct counter strategies and categorizes them by communication style. The primary aim was to explore whether these responses exhibit structured patterns, and whether communication style relates to ransom payment outcome. While no statistically significant link between communication style and payment was found, the findings reveal repeated behavioral patterns that suggest interactional structure rather than randomness. Victim replies often reflect attempts to delay, challenge, or probe the attacker, indicating that their role in negotiations may be more active and patterned than previously assumed.

Using an abductive approach, the research connects empirical insights from eight semi-structured interviews with startup founders to existing theory. Through a structured Gioia analysis, the findings show that decision-making during the survival stage is not done strictly with either causal or effectual logic. Instead, founders tend to apply both logics this is called a hybrid approach. AI appears to support this hybrid mode by structuring uncertainty, increasing operational efficiency, and facilitating access to decision-relevant information. Particularly in tasks such as forecasting or data analysis. Every entrepreneur mentioned that AI does not replace entrepreneurial judgment but functions as a support tool which provides information on which they can decide.

Findings show that value experience depends not only on system design but also on how well it matches the user’s mindset. Moderate customization combined with appropriate support generally led to more positive outcomes, while mismatches often caused frustration or doubt. Even strong support could not fully prevent negative experiences when the setup clashed with a persona’s needs.

This work presents the design, development, and validation of a Digital Twin (DT) model framework for active electronics in PV systems. This model aims to provide insights into the power output of these PV systems under changing circumstances, like temporary partial shading or irradiation changes. With these insights, algorithms and panel layouts can be compared and optimized for specific circumstances. A modular, Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) approach is used to construct a highly configurable digital model that replicates both the electrical characteristics of solar cells as well as the behavior of control algorithms running on the active hardware driving the PV panels. This simulator enables detailed loss analysis due to algorithmic inefficiencies or due to bypass diode grouping losses.
A digital twin architecture is demonstrated where a physical twin is developed, representing a full PV system with PV cells, bypass diodes, and an own developed Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) representing the active hardware. This physical twin is digitally mirrored in a digital twin using the digital model designed in this work. This digital twin architecture allows the digital model to be characterized and validated.

This study aimed to quantify diffusion coefficient (D) and perfusion-related fraction (f) measured by intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the tumour regions of LACC patients and evaluate changes in these parameters during treatment with chemoradiation (CCRT) or thermoradiotherapy (TRT). Methodology – LACC patients underwent 3.0T IVIM-DW MRI before treatment (pre-RT), at week 3 (mid-RT) and 3 months after treatment (post-RT). TRT patients were scanned immediately before and after the TRT session in week 1 and week 3. D and f were estimated using a non-segmented least squares fitting approach and quantified in the tumour region delineated after fitting. Results were evaluated for all patients and grouped by complete response to treatment, partial response to treatment, stable disease and progressive disease. Results – Twelve CCRT patients and one TRT patient were included. D and f showed an increasing trend between pre- and mid-CCRT of 19.6% and 21.6% respectively. One patient with progressive disease had a decrease in f of -86.2%. In the TRT patient, D and f increased by 9.1% and 32.3% between pre- and mid-TRT. Immediately after a TRT session, D remained stable and f increased from 5.4% to 7.6% in week 1 and from 8.5% to 10.0% in week 3. Conclusions – The preliminary findings show an increasing trend in both D and f in the LACC tumour region during CCRT or TRT, and an increase in f after a TRT session.

This study aims to evaluate the integration experience of high-skilled migrants and to discuss whether and what impact populist narratives have on this experience. Through ten semi-structured interviews, participants living in the Netherlands for at least five years were asked about their integration experience and their awareness, and the perceived impact of political narratives. The findings show that most participants have a high sense of integration but do not feel affected by political narratives, as they do not feel targeted. Furthermore, the findings underscore the unique situation of a high-skilled migrant as they disassociate from other types of migrants. As they do not identify as the group that is targeted in narratives, they do not feel affected by right-wing political narratives. Moreover, participants solely focus on direct policy implications when talking about the possible impact of populist narratives, rather than focusing on public discourse or a change in public attitudes towards migrants. Only when the narratives lead to direct policy would high-skilled migrants feel affected. This displays the importance of crafting policies with care. Policymakers should account for the different experiences and circumstances that different types of migrants have, rather than making one policy for all types of migrants.

Results showed no significant relationship between misconceptions and protective behaviours, nor differences in misconception levels between users and non-users. User status emerged as the strongest predictor of behaviour, with users engaging in fewer protective actions than non-users’ intended behaviours by asking them to imagine that they were gifted a smart speaker before being asked about their intended behaviour. Additionally, trust was found to be multidimensional and have different effects: general trust negatively predicted user status, while reputational trust positively predicted account-related protective behaviours.

So far, less is known about how individual differences influence the regulatory process of SSRL. This research aimed to investigate how individual differences, specifically the personality traits of extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, influence SSRL during a digital collaborative problem-solving task. This study aims to expand research on the impact of individual differences on SSRL among university students, as these effects have not been thoroughly examined so far. Seven groups of three students took part in this study, wherein they completed a personality test and subsequently participated in a computerized collaborative problem-solving exercise in groups of three, in which behaviors related to SSRL were coded. Results showed that the three personality traits did not significantly predict SSRL scores, according to multiple linear regression analysis. Similarly, correlational analyses revealed no statistically significant relationships between SSRL and personality. However, on the subscales of SSRL, statistical significance was measured. As extraversion positively predicted the subcategory of SSRL, metacognition, and agreeableness and conscientiousness both have a significant relationship predicting behavior, another subcategory of SSRL. Limitations of this study included a small sample size as well as limited interactivity in the digital problem-solving task.

106719,Breaking The Glass Ceiling: The Impact Of Boardroom Diversity On The Gender Pay Gap,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106719,"This bachelor thesis investigates the relationship between boardroom diversity and the gender pay gap in large firms based in the United Kingdom. Boardroom diversity is considered through two dimensions: gender diversity (share of female executives) and nationality diversity (origin of executives with attention to gender quota policies). The gender pay gap, a persistent indicator of structural inequality, may be influenced by the composition of top level leadership teams. 
Using a cross-sectional dataset of 1280 companies, this study merges UK government gender pay gap disclosures with board composition data from Orbis. The analysis employs multivariate regression, interaction models and non-linear robustness checks to assess the relationship between leadership diversity and gender-based pay disparities. Control variables include company size, industry type, and public or private sector status. The results show that gender diversity in executive leadership is significantly  associated with a lower gender pay gap, particularly when the portion of female executives exceeds the 30% threshold, supporting the critical mass theory.",Bachelor International Business Administration (B-IBA),"Heuvel, Bastiënne van den",June 2025,English,"No

human gaze estimation can be modelled with an average brightness mechanism, split into
four sectors or in other words, a quad brightness mechanism.  The aim of this paper was to confirm
whether humans are indeed able to estimate gaze in a quad brightness condition and,
secondly, to test their accuracy in such a condition. For this research, face images were created and manipulated to show four quadrants
with average brightness. These images were run through the times 70ms, 140ms, 400ms,
600ms and 1000ms in both original and manipulated form and participants estimated the gaze
orientation of each conditions faces. It was found that participants were able to estimate the gaze orientation of quad
brightness images. Their accuracy was, however, somewhat worse with a deviation of 10°. In
a larger context and based on the findings, it is likely that the quad brightness process models,

A mixed-methods approach was used, combining qualitative interviews with an exploratory data framework analysis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients, parents, and healthcare professionals. The interviews reveal that the post-diagnostic period for rare disease patients is often complex and fragmented. Respondents indicate challenges in the coordination of their care, communication, and a lack of awareness. Moreover, the respondents indicate an unclear role division of healthcare providers, wereby a single point of contact is often unclear or absent. The available psychosocial support also lacks the ability to meet the complex patient needs, negatively affecting their well-being. Mapping patient pathways requires data elements such as symptoms before and after diagnosis, treatment options, and follow-up support.

106713,Exploring the Interaction of Mood States and Food Purchasing Behaviour – Insights from an ESM study,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106713,"Food purchasing has a wide impact on our society’s health and our environment and is influenced by psychological factors. This study examined the relationship between mood and food purchasing by employing the approach of an Experience Sampling Method (ESM) which proves to be an ecologically valid method to provide new insights into real-world behaviour. It was hypothesized that a higher combined mood score, indicating higher positive relative to negative mood, would lead to healthier food items bought. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that unhealthy food purchases are linked to a more positive mood, as reflected in a higher combined mood score. 
The study included 24 participants of mostly female German students. They were asked to fill in a mood questionnaire of six items (a self-adapted version of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale; PANAS-x) and record their food purchases through either a photo diary, or, if unable to do so, through one multiple choice question (Healthy and Unhealthy Eating Behaviour Scale; HUEBS). This design was employed through an app and participants were prompted to answer the questionnaires three times per day for seven days. 
 	Multilevel analysis showed that there was no effect of mood on food purchasing items in terms of their healthiness. In the reverse association, there was no effect of the healthy or unhealthy food bought on mood state. 
 	This study contributes to the existing research, emphasizing the ESM as approach by using ecologically valid data, going beyond artificial lab settings or retrospective surveys. Since there was no interaction found between mood and food purchasing, it may be that budgetary reasons where a stronger predictor on healthy food purchases than mood.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Jetter, Chiara",June 2025,English,"No

Despite frequent reports of moral licensing tendencies and unhealthy food purchases, the
multilevel analysis between moral licensing and unhealthy food purchases revealed no
significant effect. The results suggest that moral licensing may have limited applicability in the
domain of food-related decisions, underscoring the importance of exploring domain and
contextual elements in consumer behaviour. In light of future research, the current study calls for

Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to provide guidelines enabling inclusive park designs by answering the question of: what makes public parks safe and pleasant for queer individuals? To answer the question, this study utilised a questionnaire in combination with stamps for participants to create their ideal park. Therefore, this study also tested a cost-efficient and low-tech method of data collection. A total of 51 participants were included, of which 23 participants indicated to be queer. Queer and non-queer participants did not differ significantly in how safe they feel in public parks or in what features make a park safe and pleasant to be in.

106706,Evaluating the Impact of Evidence Disclosure Timings on Rapport and Information Sharing during Suspect Interviews,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106706,"Investigative interviews are a common practice by the police in the investigation of crimes to gain as much true information about an incident possible. To support investigators in achieving this goal, the current study examined how the disclosure timing of evidence inherent to different interviewing techniques influences the development of rapport and the amount of information shared by the suspect with the interviewer. The two techniques examined are the Tactical use of evidence (TUE) to which a gradual evidence disclosure is central, and the Strategic use of evidence (SUE) that is characterized by a late evidence disclosure. To do so, a 2 (suspect status: guilty vs. innocent) x 2 (disclosure timing: late vs. gradual) design was implemented, replicating an online study by Geschiere (2025), with the difference that the current study took place in a face-to-face setting. The participants of this study (N = 93) took part in a mock suspect interview, which was followed by questionnaire that evaluated the rapport established during the interview, while counting the pieces of novel information shared. The first 2 × 2 ANOVA revealed no significant effect of disclosure timing and suspect status on rapport, so innocent suspects did not report higher rapport than guilty suspects, regardless of the interviewing technique. Contrary, the second 2 × 2 ANOVA revealed significant effects of disclosure timing and suspect status on information sharing. Concretely, a gradual evidence disclosure was associated with higher information sharing, especially among innocent suspects. These findings suggest that in comparison to revealing evidence at the end of the interviews, a gradual evidence disclosure motivates suspects to share more information, which supports interviewers in achieving the goal of suspect interviewing.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Heuking, Caroline",June 2025,English,"No

While prior research suggests that SRL is essential for successful engagement in IBL, it remains unclear how these skills manifest among learners with different competence levels, particularly in primary education. This exploratory study examined which SRL behaviours are demonstrated by children with High, Average and Low competence levels during an individual, digital IBL task. Learners in their final year of primary school (N = 31) completed a simulation-based task while thinking aloud. Verbal data were analysed using an observation scheme based on Zimmerman’s Cyclical Phases Model of SRL. Overall, SRL behaviours were observed most frequently during the investigation phase of the inquiry cycle, while the orientation and discussion phases elicited few observable SRL behaviours. When comparing competence groups, only a significant difference was found only for the behaviour of predicting, with average-competence students engaging in this more frequently than low-competence peers. These findings suggest that the relationship between competence level and SRL may be more complex than assumed and not easily captured through thinking-aloud data alone. Future research could benefit from incorporating complementary methods to better understand the nuances of SRL in IBL contexts.

They were then asked to rank a list of 20 park features based on how important participants perceived them to be for both safety and pleasantness. Then they used stamps to design their ideal park on an outline based on Enschede Volkspark. Quantitative analysis of the ranking questions showed that important safety features included streetlights, open spaces, and accessible walking paths. Meanwhile the most important features for pleasantness were decorative elements, accessible walking paths, and open spaces. Qualitative analysis of participant responses to the questions provided a richer insight into why participants ranked the features the way they did.

Grounded in Ashford and Cummings’ (1983) cost-value framework and Media Richness Theory (Daft & Lengel, 1975), it examines how HW’s technological context influences FS behavior. Semi-structured interviews in a partially agile case company reveal that insufficient target information in HW creates a new cost—availability costs—stemming from uncertainty about when feedback sources are accessible. This uncertainty often delays FS, as employees hesitate or wait until target availability becomes clearer. HW also heightens inference costs due to the limited social cues in digital communication, even in video calls, restricting the use of passive FS strategies like monitoring. Consequently, employees rely more on direct inquiry or defer FS until in-person interactions, reducing their strategic flexibility. However, agile work environments appear to buffer these challenges through structured feedback processes and a strong emphasis on feedback’s informational value. Overall, the study extends the cost-value framework by introducing availability costs and enriching the concept of inference costs in digitally mediated settings. It also highlights how organizational design, particularly agile methodologies, can sustain effective FS behaviors in hybrid contexts.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Scheel, Sarafina",June 2025,English,"No.

The predictive role of the Big Five traits was examined across three subdimensions of self-reflection: Need for Self-Reflection (NSR), Engagement in Self-Reflection (ESR), and Insight (ISR). Data from 158 participants were analysed using hierarchical regression and moderation analysis. Openness to Experience emerged as the most consistent predictor across all three subdimensions, highlighting its links to cognitive flexibility and self-exploration. Neuroticism predicted both NSR and ESR positively but was negatively associated with ISR, suggesting a dual role in promoting reflective effort while hindering clarity. Conscientiousness and Extraversion showed weaker or subdimension-specific effects. Of six tested moderators – age, educational background, emotional disclosure, sexual orientation, therapeutic experience, and major life events – only age and education moderated the relationship between Openness and NSR. No significant moderation effects were found for ESR or ISR. These findings indicate that while personality plays a central role in shaping self-reflective tendencies, some aspects of reflection may be more trait-like and stable, while others remain sensitive to experience.

106691,Regulating Buyer Power : Government Intervention in Jamaica’s Coffee Sector,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106691,"This study explores how government intervention can rebalance power relations in Jamaica’s coffee sector. Despite the premium status and high export value associated with Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, smallholder farmers remain marginalised in global supply chains. Multinational buyers and regulatory bodies dominate the market, leaving producers with little influence over pricing or access to value-adding stages of the value chain. Using Emerson (1962) Power Dependency Theory, the study explores how dependency arises from high motivational investment and a lack of alternatives. Based on six interviews with smallholder farmers, exporters, and NGO members, the study shows how institutional barriers reinforce power imbalances in the global value chain. Although there are support activities for farmers, they remain limited and inconsistent. The results of this study suggest that buyer-driven supplier development is ineffective in places with extreme power imbalances. The state can act as a non-traditional actor by enforcing minimum price policies and lowering entry barriers. However, institutional reform is crucial to make these changes effective. This study makes an academic contribution to the literature on supplier development by broadening the focus beyond firm-driven initiatives and adds to the field of Purchasing and Supply Management by framing buyer power as a core structural issue within global agri-food value chains.

106690,The Impact of Connectedness on Mental Health : Testing the Mediating Role of Eating Behaviour,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106690,"This study explored the relationship between connectedness, healthy eating behaviour, and mental health in adults. It was hypothesised that individuals’ feelings of connectedness would predict better mental health and healthier eating behaviours, and that healthy eating behaviour would mediate the relationship between connectedness and mental health. A quantitative cross-sectional research design was used. The data was collected using an online questionnaire completed by 90 participants aged between 18 and 67. The questionnaire measuring the three study variables included the Watts Connectedness Scale, the Healthy and Unhealthy Eating Behaviour Scale, and the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form. Regression and mediation analyses were conducted to test whether connectedness predicted mental health and healthy eating behaviour, and whether eating behaviour mediated the relationship between connectedness and mental health. The regression analysis revealed that connectedness predicted mental health. The multiple regression analysis examining the three subdimensions of connectedness as predictors of healthy eating behaviour revealed only connectedness to the world as a significant predictor. The mediation analysis showed that eating behaviour did not mediate the link between connectedness and mental health. The finding that connectedness to the world predicts healthy eating underscores the potential of nature- or environment-focused interventions.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Heinz, Jana",May 2025,English,"No

106687,The effects of external pressures such as shareholder activism on corporate sustainability strategies in the Dutch high-emission fossil fuel industry: A media-based case study of Shell,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106687,"As climate change drives the global push for sustainability, understanding how companies respond to external pressure is crucial. This thesis investigates the impact of shareholder activism and other external forces on corporate sustainability strategies in the Dutch high-emission fossil fuel industry, with Shell serving as the primary case study. The Dutch context, known for its strong regulatory environment and active civil society, offers a unique lens for examining these interactions. Drawing on stakeholder and institutional theory, and using Frooman’s and Oliver’s frameworks, this research analyses qualitative media data from 2015 to 2025 to reveal how coordinated actions, such as shareholder resolutions, legal challenges, and public campaigns shape Shell’s sustainability commitments. The findings show that sustained, multi-level pressure led Shell to adapt its strategies in response to evolving stakeholder expectations. By applying Frooman’s stakeholder influence strategies and Oliver’s organisational response typology, this study shows how different types of external pressure influence a company’s decisions and the ways companies respond to these pressures. These theoretical insights help explain why some strategies by stakeholders are more effective than others and highlight the importance of coordinated action.

As a result, entrepreneurship is often viewed as a way to promote sustainability and address environmental issues. While previous research has primarily focused on variables that influence general entrepreneurial intention, there is limited research on factors specifically affecting green entrepreneurial intention. This study aims to explore whether metacognitive awareness is associated with green entrepreneurial intention and to identify which subcomponents are most relevant. Green entrepreneurship has been linked to skills such as problem-solving, self-regulation, and strategic decision-making, abilities closely related to metacognitive awareness. University students were chosen as the target group due to evidence suggesting that educational settings significantly influence entrepreneurial intention. The goal is to identify skills that could be developed through education to foster sustainable entrepreneurial intentions. A cross-sectional survey design was used, involving 47 university students. Participants completed an online questionnaire measuring demographics, metacognitive awareness, and green entrepreneurial intention (GEI). Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between overall metacognitive awareness and GEI.

This study examines how time pressure influences the relationship between managerial attention and decision-making effectiveness. Specifically, it aims to answer: How does time pressure influence the relationship between managerial attention and decision-making effectiveness? Based on the Attention-Based View and theories of bounded rationality, it was expected that managerial attention would enhance decision quality, but that this effect might weaken under time pressure. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 52 purchasing professionals across manufacturing and service sectors. Managerial attention, perceived time pressure, and decision-making effectiveness were measured using validated scales. The data were analyzed using multiple regression. The results show that higher levels of managerial attention are linked to better decision-making effectiveness. However, the expected moderating effect of time pressure was not confirmed.

regulation. This highlights the need for scalable, self-guided interventions. This study tested whether a
one-week, smartphone-delivered mentalization-based expressive writing task could reduce stress and
improve mentalization and self-efficacy. Eight participants (aged 18–29) completed a two-week
within-person AB design intervention: during both weeks, they responded to five ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) prompts per day, and in Week B they additionally completed one daily 5–10 minute
expressive writing session focused on mentalization. At each EMA prompt, participants rated their current
levels of stress, mentalization, and self-efficacy using single-item visual analogue sliders. Data were
analyzed using linear mixed-effects models and individual-level contrasts. Writing adherence was high.
what was found was that there were no immediate improvements following the writing sessions.
Post-writing scores for stress (b = 1.72, p = .58), mentalization (b = –0.20, p = .93), and self-efficacy (b =
0.03, p = .99) showed no significant change, indicating that participants did not experience short-term
psychological benefits directly after engaging in the task. Looking at the broader effect across the entire
writing week, stress levels remained stable (b = –0.03, p = .98), but both mentalization and self-efficacy
declined significantly (b = –4.59, p < .01; b = –5.48, p < .01), suggesting potential cumulative negative
effects over time. Individual patterns varied, with some participants improving while others worsened.
These findings suggest that a brief, unguided mentalization-through-writing task may be insufficient and in
some cases counterproductive for decreasing stress. Future studies should explore longer, guided protocols

To address this issue, the Dutch government is implementing ERTMS/ETCS Level 2. This study evaluated the performance of five block section design strategies under ERTMS/ETCS Level 2 in both normal and disrupted conditions. Key Performance Indicators were identified through a literature review and validated via interviews with stakeholders. Under normal conditions, the following indicators were examined: capacity, travel time, travel time deviation and infrastructure costs. During disruptions, resilience (recovery and disruption period) and the Weighted Travel Time Extension were evaluated. Simulations using OpenTrack were conducted on three corridors with varying traffic volumes. The results show that during non-disruptive conditions, ERTMS/ETCS Level 2 improved capacity and travel time on high-traffic routes compared to the NS'54/ATB-EG system. However, the benefits are limited on low-volume routes due to conservative braking curves. Strategies involving short blocks performed best under normal conditions.

These countries have experienced a significant decline in the number of listed companies since peak. Despite the economic significance of private firms, significantly less is known about their financial reporting practices compared to public firms. This study explores how variations in ownership concentration, managerial ownership, foreign ownership, and private equity ownership influence earnings management. Earnings management is measured using discretionary accruals (DACC), estimated via the modified Jones model, and abnormal working capital accruals (AWCA), computed as per the DeFond and Park model. Data is obtained from Orbis and (semi-)public financial statements to calculate earnings management and gather information on firms' ownership structures. I run multiple regression models to test the magnitude and direction of earnings management, using absolute and signed values, respectively. Based on a sample size of 811 firm-years between 2019-2024 in the Benelux, the results show that foreign ownership is associated with a higher magnitude of earnings management. Private equity ownership is associated with a directional influence. I find no significant associations between either concentrated or managerial ownership and earnings management.

They found a significant gap between what intelligent technologies social bots could use in theory and the predominantly simple technologies used in practice. Five years later, after the huge boom in both popularity and accessibility of Large Language Model (LLM) technologies, this has changed. The aim of this work was to map out the current landscape of social media bots on GitHub and procure empirical evidence of how, if at all, LLM technologies are being used by social bots. This thesis shows the developments in the overall ecosystem of social media bots on GitHub, finding that largely thanks to bots for WhatsApp and Telegram, the number of repositories has tripled and is increasingly growing. Manual analysis of popular repositories as well as advanced topic modelling of all repository descriptions exposes a large variety of social media bots on GitHub, both in terms of purpose and in terms of technologies used to create them. Furthermore, it is explored how publicly available social bot repositories can be used to gain insight into the practical use of LLM technologies by social bots. By exploiting multiple novel analysis methods, including the use of Google Gemini Pro to analyse source code, this thesis finds that an estimated 10.58% of social bot repositories use LLM technologies across nine different social media platforms. The majority of these (almost all benign) social bots utilise accessible LLM Application Program Interfaces (APIs), like the one maintained by OpenAI.

To reduce SpO₂  overload, a Smart Alarm Delay (SAD) model was implemented on March 6. This study aimed to design a user-friendly Power BI dashboard and evaluate the statistical impact of the SAD model on alarm frequency and escalation. A literature review and iterative design cycle led to a dashboard with three pages, displaying alarm trends, escalation levels, and bed-specific alarm counts. User feedback across four rounds shaped its development. Statistical analysis showed that alarm data were not normally distributed, justifying the use of a Mann-Whitney U test, which revealed a significant reduction in total SpO₂ alarms (p < 2.2e-16). The proportion of SpO₂ alarms compared to all alarms also decreased significantly. While escalation rates for SpO₂ alarms to level 1 and 2 remained stable, the overall proportion of alarms escalating to levels 1 and 2 dropped significantly after SAD implementation. This suggests an improvement in alarm handling and nurse efficiency. In conclusion, the SAD model reduced alarm frequency without affecting response urgency for SpO₂ alarms.

De keuze hiertussen wordt mede bepaald door het chirurgisch zicht, waarvoor een objectieve, preoperatieve analysemethode ontbreekt.
Doel: Dit onderzoek ontwikkelt en evalueert een 3D-workflow om het chirurgisch zicht op de STAMCO S1-regio kwantitatief te analyseren op basis van patiëntspecifieke CT-scans. Met als doel de preoperatieve planning te ondersteunen.
Methode: Een 3D-model werd gecreëerd uit een CT-scan met behulp van een gevalideerd Deep Learning Model voor automatische segmentatie. Via virtuele CWD- en CWU-benaderingen en een raycasting-module in 3D Slicer werd het zicht op de S1-regio gekwantificeerd en vergeleken.
Resultaten: De CWD-techniek bood een significant (p<0,05) beter zicht op de S1-regio (8,2%) dan de CWU-techniek (4,4%), een toename van 85,1%. De ontwikkelde workflow werd door KNO-artsen als matig bruikbaar beoordeeld (SUS-score: 60), maar zij zagen potentie voor toekomstige toepassing.

Het doel is het verbeteren van de nauwkeurigheid van perfusiemetingen, uitgevoerd met tweedimensionale Perfusie Angiografie (2D-PA), Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) en Fluorescentie Angiografie (FA). De centrale onderzoeksvraag luidt: ""Hoe kan de voet van een patiënt met perifeer arterieel vaatlijden, waarvan het been kritisch ischemisch is, effectief worden gefixeerd tijdens revascularisatieprocedures in de hybride operatiekamer, zonder interferentie met beeldvorming of procedure?"". Deelvragen richten zich op immobilisatie, materiaalkeuze, wondvriendelijkheid, ontwerp, reproduceerbaarheid van perfusiebeeldvorming, patiëntveiligheid, gebruiksgemak en productiemethode. In deze opdracht zijn verschillende varianten van thermoplastische voetmaskers ontworpen en geëvalueerd. Stralingsdosisonderzoek toont aan dat het gebruik van een thermoplastisch voetmasker de stralingsbelasting voor patiënt en personeel niet verhoogt. Validatie-experimenten met LSCI laten zien dat thermoplastische voetmaskers zowel de toename in perfusion unit als de verplaatsing van regions of interest na beweging significant reduceren, wat leidt tot een verbeterde betrouwbaarheid van perfusiemetingen. Hoewel de resultaten veelbelovend zijn, kan op basis van de huidige data geen definitieve keuze worden gemaakt voor het optimale maskerontwerp; aanvullend onderzoek naar bewegingsvrijheid en optimaal maskeroppervlak is noodzakelijk. Het uiteindelijke prototype, bestaande uit een thermoplastisch voetmasker, MonoFix en Mono Clamps, is ontwikkeld met aandacht voor effectieve fixatie, patiëntveiligheid en integratie in de OK-workflow, zonder verstoring van beeldvormingstechnieken. Praktische validatie in een klinische hybride OK-setting is echter nog niet uitgevoerd en vormt een essentiële vervolgstap richting implementatie. Toekomstig onderzoek dient zich te richten op optimalisatie van ontwerp en materiaal, alsmede op de impact van het systeem op stralingsbelasting en beeldkwaliteit.

106657,"De validiteit, kosteneffectiviteit en uitvoerbaarheid van Point-Of-Care Ultrasound thorax (POCUS-thorax) bij een pneumonie in een acute setting",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106657,"Achtergrond: Een pneumonie is een veelvoorkomende longaandoening binnen de acute zorg, waarbij
een tijdige en nauwkeurige diagnose essentieel is. Bij verdenking van een pneumonie wordt als standaard beeldvormende techniek een X-thorax uitgevoerd en bij onduidelijke bevindingen een CT-thorax. Beide technieken hebben echter beperkingen. Traditioneel werd gedacht dat longechografie geen toegevoegde waarde had als diagnostisch middel voor respiratoire aandoeningen, wegens het grote impedantie verschil tussen weefsel en lucht. Bij de aanwezigheid van een pathologie ontstaan echter artefacten die klinisch relevant kunnen zijn. Een vorm van longechografie die kan worden toegepast aan het bed van de patiënt is Point-Of-Care Ultrasound thorax (POCUS-thorax). In dit onderzoek wordt de potentie van POCUS-thorax als diagnostisch middel voor een pneumonie onderzocht. 
Doel: Dit onderzoek evalueert de validiteit, kosteneffectiviteit en uitvoerbaarheid van POCUS-thorax in vergelijking met een X-thorax en CT-thorax bij patiënten met een pneumonie in een acute setting. Daarnaast worden de belemmeringen en vereisten voor de bredere implementatie van POCUS-thorax in de klinische praktijk onderzocht. 
Methode: De validiteit werd onderzocht aan de hand van een literatuuronderzoek naar de sensitiviteit en specificiteit van de drie beeldvormingsmodaliteiten. Daarnaast werden 75 geanonimiseerde echobeelden van de longen geanalyseerd, waarbij werd vastgesteld of er sprake was van aanwezigheid (1) of afwezigheid (0) van een pneumonie. De kosteneffectiviteit werd geanalyseerd door de beeldvormingsmodaliteiten te
vergelijken op het gebied van kosten en testuitkomsten. Met behulp van de Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)-methode werd de uitvoerbaarheid van POCUS-thorax vergeleken met die van X-thorax en CT-thorax, waarbij de criteria een weegfactor kregen voor de relevantie ervan op de spoedeisende hulp (SEH). Verder werden observaties uitgevoerd bij echogeleide longpuncties, werd er meegekeken hoe echografie kon worden ingezet bij patiënten met een pneumonie en werden gesprekken gevoerd met longartsen uit het MST. De belemmeringen en vereisten voor een bredere implementatie van POCUS-thorax in de klinische praktijk werd geëvalueerd met een literatuurstudie en via een interview met prof. dr. P.R. Tuinman. 
Resultaten: Longechografie toont een sensitiviteit van 88.1% en een specificiteit van 87.8%. Een X-thorax heeft een sensitiviteit van 58,5% en specificiteit van 87,3%. De CT-thorax heeft een sensitiviteit van >95% en een specificiteit van >90%. Bij de eigen analyse is de gemiddelde sensitiviteit 65,5% en de gemiddelde specificiteit 53,2%, met 59,1% correcte diagnoses. POCUS-thorax heeft een uitvoerbaarheidsscore van 65, X-thorax van 56 en de CT-thorax van 50. De totale kosten per beeldvormingstechniek zijn: €110,8 miljoen voor CT-thorax, €69,8 miljoen voor X-thorax en €98,1 miljoen voor longechografie. Daarnaast is het break-even punt voor longechografie t.o.v. X-thorax €68. Belemmeringen voor bredere implementatie zijn gebrek aan training, gestandaardiseerde richtlijnen en organisatorische ondersteuning. 
Conclusie: Longechografie heeft een hogere validiteit dan een X-thorax, maar een lagere validiteit dan een CT-thorax. Bij de eigen analyse was de sensitiviteit van POCUS-thorax hoger dan de X-thorax, de specificiteit was daarentegen lager dan die van X-thorax. De totale kosten van een longechografie zijn hoger dan een X-thorax en lager dan een CT-thorax. De score van de uitvoerbaarheid van een POCUS-thorax is het hoogst van de drie beeldvormingsmodaliteiten.

Mechanische in- en exsufflatie (MI-E) is een medisch hulpmiddel die de verstoorde hoestfunctie ondersteunt. MI-E blaast lucht in de longen van de patiënten en onttrekt deze vervolgens weer, waardoor een kunst matige hoest ontstaat. De patiënt wordt hierdoor ondersteund bij het verwijderen van sputum. Het
is mogelijk om oscillaties toe te voegen aan de luchtstroom van de MI-E. Hoewel deze trillingen in de praktijk door patiënten en verpleegkundig specialisten als aangenaam zijn ervaren, is de meerwaarde niet wetenschappelijk bewezen. In dit onderzoek is de invloed van oscillaties op sputumverplaatsing in een longmodel onderzocht. 
Om tot een antwoord te komen is gebruikgemaakt van een versimpeld longmodel, bestaande uit een buis en een ballon. In dit longmodel zijn verschillende parameters meegenomen, zoals de buisdiameter, de viscositeit van het simulatiesputum en verschillende oscillatie-instellingen, met sputumverplaatsing als uitkomstmaat. Na analyse van de resultaten bleek dat oscillaties tijdens exsufflatie in de dikke buis, representatief voor de trachea, zorgden voor een verbeterde sputumverplaatsing. Dit zou in de praktijk betekenen dat sputum in de hogere luchtwegen effectiever wordt geklaard wanneer oscillaties tijdens exsufflatie worden toegepast. Ook in de kleinere luchtwegen blijken oscillaties tijdens de exsufflatie verbeterde verplaatsing op te leveren. Dit geldt alleen voor dunner sputum, bij dikker sputum is de MI-E zonder oscillaties het meest effectief Aangezien dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd in een versimpeld longmodel, zijn de resultaten niet direct toepas

106654,Relatie tussen MRI-features en EEG-patronen bij postanoxische comapatiënten,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106654,"Background: After successful resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, many patients remain comatose due to severe post-anoxic encephalopathy. Only about 50% of these patients recover, while the rest either die or remain permanently dependent on care. EEG is a key tool in prognostication, often complemented by neurological assessment. Prior studies suggest that MRI can offer insights into the structural and functional brain changes underlying EEG patterns. This study investigates which MRI features correlate with prognostic EEG patterns in post-anoxic comatose patients. Methods: This retrospective study included patients from Rijnstate Hospital (Arnhem) and Radboudumc (Nijmegen) who underwent continuous EEG monitoring during the first three days post-cardiac arrest. MRI scans were acquired between 1.5 and 10 days after the event. From these, 27 clinically relevant features were extracted. Random forest models were trained on all possible combinations of three features to classify patients into four EEG-defined groups. The models were validated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, and SHAP values were used to assess feature importance. Results: Among 76 patients, the combination of three MRI features—default mode network intensity in the posterior cingulate cortex, mean diffusivity in the occipital cortex, and fractional anisotropy in white matter—achieved the highest discrimination (macro-AUC: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.73–0.95).

However, its clinical and preclinical applications are limited by inherently low sensitivity, resulting in poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This study investigates the impact of various post-processing techniques - specifically denoising and super-resolution - on the 19F image quality. The goal was to enhance both SNR and CNR while preserving structural integrity, as measured by the structural similarity index (SSIM). A range of classical image processing methods and deep learning-based approaches were implemented and tested in multiple combinations on phantom datasets. The top three performing post-processing pipelines, identified based on quantitative image quality metrics, were further validated in vivo using mouse models. The result showed that applying Block Matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) was the most effective way to enhance SNR and CNR while maintaining acceptable SSIM. Additionally, this study found promising results in deep learning models specifically trained for this data. These results demonstrate clear improvements
in image clarity and quality, suggesting that tailored post-processing can significantly enhance the utility of 19F MRI in both research and potentially clinical applications.",Bachelor Technical Medicine (B-TG),"Eijmers, V., Have, T.A. van der, Persaud, J.J., Prins, S.C.A.",June 2025,English,"No.

106651,Microwave Ablation for Lung Tumours up to 3 cm : Influencing Factors and Lessons Learnt from Liver Ablation and Clinical Expertise,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106651,"Microwave ablation (MWA) is a well-established technique for treating hepatic tumours. However, its application in the lung presents distinct challenges due to differences in anatomy and physiology. This can lead to altered ablation dynamics and clinical outcomes, rendering direct application of liver protocols inadequate. To better understand how MWA can be applied effectively in the lungs, this ex- ploratory study examines what can be learnt from the practice of MWA in the liver. To understand lung MWA and its limitations, this paper provides an overview of the key factors that influence the use of MWA in lung tissue. In addition, we address the procedural and technical challenges encountered in liver MWA, including imaging dependency, ablative margin requirements, complication management and the critical role of patient selection and assess their relevance in the context of lung ablation. Segmentation of both the tumour and the associated ablation zone allows evaluation of the efficacy of the treatment in pulmonary ablation, facilitating a direct comparison with established hepatic outcomes. The under- estimated ablation zone, combined with the single-lung ventilation and higher heating rates, leads to the conclusion that MWA can be done in a shorter period of time and lung damage can be minimised while providing more spherical ablation zones, potentially improving treatment outcomes. This study shows that key anatomical and physiological differences between the liver and lung considerably influence the effectiveness and predictability of the MWA procedure and that standardised procedures based on consensus and attention to tissue differences are needed.",Bachelor Technical Medicine (B-TG),"Hogewoning, S.G., Speksnijder, H.H.W, Kaak, D.A.W., Kamphuis, J.C.",June 2025,English,"No.

106648,No Extra Sensors Needed : Estimating Vertical Ground Reaction Force Using Wearables Runners Already Use,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106648,"Understanding the factors contributing to running-related injuries is of high importance, as injuries are common
among runners. Ground reaction forces (GRFs) are potentially useful in quantifying the biomechanical load
during running, but can only be measured reliably in a gait laboratory using force plates. To study GRF
continuously outdoors, wearable sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) can be used. These IMUs
are also present in smartwatches and advanced heart rate monitor belts. This study aimed to predict vertical
GRF (vGRF) using IMUs positioned at the wrist and sternum, mimicking smartwatch and heart rate strap
placement, combined with smartwatch-derived variables. Twelve rearfoot strike runners ran on a forceplate
instrumented treadmill at four speeds (8, 10, 12, 14 km/h) and three cadences (preferred ± 10%) across twelve
trials of 90 seconds. Participants wore IMUs on the wrist and sternum (capturing 3D accelerations and angular
velocities) and pressure insoles, providing vGRF estimates, which were used for outdoor validation. Following
indoor trials, participants performed four rounds on an athletics track at the same four speeds. A long short-
term memory neural network was trained to predict vGRF using IMU signals and smartwatch-derived variables.
Feature importance analysis revealed that the sternum IMU was the most informative predictor. Leave-one-
subject-out cross-validation resulted in an RMSE of 0.10 ± 0.024 Body Weight. Outdoor validation using
pressure insoles did not show significant differences in model performance between indoor and outdoor trials.

Dit kan gevaarlijke gevolgen hebben voor de patiënt. Een stap in de richting van goed passende canules is het in kaart brengen van de bewegingen die de trachea maakt bij ADL. Dit geeft inzicht in de vormverandering en is de eerste stap richting een toekomstig protocol voor optimale canule keuze. 
Om deze vormveranderingen te analyseren zijn een aantal bewegingen bepaald die mensen kunnen maken met het hoofd en de hals. Vervolgens zijn de uiterste houdingen in beeld gebracht met een MRI-scanner. Om de houdingen te vergelijken met de rustpositie, zijn er segmentaties gemaakt. Dit werd gedaan in het programma 3DSlicer, waar ook verschillende vormgevende eigenschappen in zijn gemeten. Daarnaast is een canule gevisualiseerd in de segmentaties voor klinische relevantie.
Uit deze resultaten kwam dat de trachea over het algemeen meebeweegt met de houding van het hoofd en de hals, maar de mate van verandering varieert per individu. Daarnaast blijkt dat de positie en vorm van de canule afgestemd moet zijn op de vormverandering van de trachea om wandschade te voorkomen.

When using multiple needles, they must be placed parallel to each other and 15 mm apart. Currently, this is done freehand, which often requires the needles to be repositioned. Robots are being developed to place the needles more accurately. However, these robots are expensive. Therefore, there is a need for the design of a cheap, easy-to-use instrument. Hence, the main question is: ‘How to develop an instrument that simplifies the process of accurate placement of multiple ablation needles when treating liver tumours (up to 50 mm) with MWA or IRE compared to freehand needle placement?’
To answer this question the design cycle was used and completed three times. In each cycle, relevant background information was researched, and requirements were defined. Based on these, brainstorm sessions were held after which the possible designs were tested by evaluating them with the supervisors.

106642,The impact of visual complexity on real world banner advertisement performance on an E-commerce platform,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106642,"Purpose: This study was performed to investigate the impact of visual complexity (henceforth, VC) in static banner advertisements on advertising performance within E-commerce yielding theoretical implications and practical guidance for banner design strategies. 
Method: Based on a literature review, VC was defined. The following indicators were used: text length, image count, colour variety, font variety, symmetry, and element overlap. Advertising performance metrics are automatically generated through the platforms internal analytics system. Advertising performance was assessed across three key metrics: click-through rate (CTR), brand cart additions, and promoted return on advertising spend (pROAS), corresponding to the attention, consideration, and conversion phases of the customer journey. Study sample: From an E-commerce platform’s internal analytic system, the performance data of the year 2024 was retrieved for Fast Moving Consumer Goods campaigns (henceforth, FMCG). This dataset included 232 banner advertisements. After excluding banners with missing performance data, the final sample included 216 banner advertisements. Data Analysis: Of the 216 banner advertisements, manual content analysis was performed to assess VC. Next, multiple regression analyses were performed to investigate the effect of VC indicators on the three advertising performance metrics. Additionally, Exploratory Factor Analyses (EFA) were performed to investigate whether latent VC has an effect on advertising performance. 
Result: Descriptive analyses revealed variation in banner VC, particularly in text length, image count, and font variety. Advertising performance metrics brand cart add and pROAS exhibited non-normal distributions. The impact of the VC indicators (i.e., text length, image count, colour variety, font variety, symmetry, and element overlap) on CTR, Bard Cart addition and pROAS was not significant; for CTR (F(5, 210) = 1.67, p = .143, R² = .038);  Brand cart add (F(5, 210) = 1.09, p = .369, R² = .025); and pROAS logistic regression (χ2(7)=8.99, p=.253). Additionally, exploratory factor analysis identified a latent VC factor comprising element overlap, image count, and font size variety. The impact of this factor was statistically significant on all three advertising performance metrics (CTR, F(1, 214) = 10.42, p = .001, R² = .046; brand cart additions, F(1, 214) = 8.20, p = .005, R² = .037; and pROAS, F(1, 214) = 4.93, p = .027, R² = .023). This indicates that higher element overlap, image count, and font size variety are associated with improved advertising performance, suggesting that banners with greater visual complexity tend to yield better outcomes. However, explained variance is low (R² = .023–.046), indicating other unknown variables can influence advertising performance.
Conclusion: This study investigated the impact of VC in static banner advertisements on advertising performance within E-commerce. The impact of the VC indicators individually was not significant. However, a latent factor, including element overlap, image count and font size variety did have an impact on advertising performance in each phase (CTR, brand cart additions, and pROAS). This indicates that banners perform better when these visual indicators are combined. Therefore, defining visual complexity in the E-commerce context should focus on element overlap, image count, and font size variety.

A new biomarker is needed to monitor cognitive decline in children with DEE-SWAS, since the current spike-wave index (SWI) is not clearly related to intelligence quotient tests, through which cognitive decline is measured. Therefore, we investigated sleep spindles. We compared this with the correlation between SWI and cognition. Our research question was: ”Is the correlation between sleep spindles and cognition higher than the correlation between SWI and cognition?”. A retrospective observational study was conducted. We analysed the correlation with sleep spindle characteristics (spindle rate, duration and frequency) with the Spearman correlation. We found no evidence that sleep spindles have a higher correlation with cognition compared to SWI. All Spearman correlations have no significant results. The low sample size, spindle and sleep annotation criteria by SleepRT and chosen definitions for spindle frequencies may be contributing factors to this result. For future research, we recommend exploring different algorithms for sleep spindle annotation and including more EEGs. These efforts may ultimately help improve diagnosis and treatment strategies for children with DEE-SWAS.",Bachelor Technical Medicine (B-TG),"Broeke, T.R., Dongen, C.A. van, Roos, S. de, Vennekens, H.",June 2025,English,"No

106640,Democratie en polarisatie: deliberatieve democratie als lijm? : Een onderzoek naar beleid rondom deliberatieve democratie en maatschappelijke weerstand in de Twentse gemeenten,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106640,"Deze masterthesis onderzoekt hoe Twentse gemeenten in de afgelopen tien jaar hebben geprobeerd om via deliberatieve democratie maatschappelijke spanningen te verminderen. De centrale onderzoeksvraag luidt: Hoe hebben Twentse gemeenten de afgelopen tien jaar via deliberatieve democratie polarisatie tussen burger en overheid, die zich uit in burgerlijke
ongehoorzaamheid, aangepakt? De analyse richt zich op vier casussen waarin maatschappelijke weerstand zichtbaar was: de plaatsing van windturbines in Hengelo, de komst van een asielzoekerscentrum in Tubbergen, de bouw van een moskee in Enschede en de vestiging van een AZC in Enschede. Door middel van documentanalyse en contentanalyse werd onderzocht welke vormen van
burgerbetrokkenheid werden toegepast, en in hoeverre deze voldoen aan de kenmerken van deliberatieve democratie. De resultaten laten zien dat deliberatieve democratie in wisselende mate wordt toegepast. In sommige gevallen werd geprobeerd om via burgerpanels, inspraakavonden of omgevingsgroepen burgers actief te betrekken. In andere gevallen bleef participatie of vond deze pas plaats nadat het vertrouwen van de burgers al geschaad was. De thesis concludeert dat deliberatieve democratie potentie heeft om depolariserend te werken, maar dat de effectiviteit hiervan dan wel sterk afhankelijk is van de inrichting van het proces. 
Deze processen dienen laagdrempelig, inclusief en transparant te zijn. Wanneer dit niet gebeurt, dan kan dit averechts werken en juist de relatie tussen burger en overheid verder beschadigen.
De aanbeveling luidt dan ook dat gemeenten verder moeten kijken dan formele participatie, en moeten investeren in structurele en betekenisvolle dialoog met burgers, juist bij gevoelige en polariserende onderwerpen.

Ageing is associated with poorer physical and mental health. Therefore, there is an increasing need for opportunities to promote good health and well-being. Parks are known to benefit the health of people of all ages, yet little is done in park design that facilitates the needs of elderly people. The aim of this study was to explore what characteristics make a park feel safe and pleasant for elderly people. Participants were interviewed in their homes about their perceptions of safety and pleasantness relating to parks in general as well as the Volkspark in Enschede. They were asked to complete a park design assignment as well. All surveys and designs were analysed using excel, R-studio and QGIS. Participants primarily reported using parks for walking and enjoying their surroundings in a park. Park features valued highly for safety include good lighting, visibility and natural features. For pleasantness main themes such as natural features, park design and subjective experiences were valued highly.

Research suggests a maximum of 12-16 feeds per operator, but operators often monitor more. This study investigated how feed count affects subjective and objective mental workload and performance. In a within-subjects design, 16 operators monitored prerecorded traffic across 8, 16, or 24 feeds, responding to incidents via keypress, signaling incident detection. Subjective mental workload was assessed via NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), objective mental workload was measured via blink rate and pupil diameter, and performance was measured using response count, total response time and post-fixation response time. Data were analyzed using mixed effects models, with Karolinska Sleepiness Scale scores as a covariate. NASA-TLX scores, blink rates, response counts and response times did not differ with the number of camera feeds. Feed count influenced pupil diameter, with post-hoc tests unexpectedly showing larger pupil diameters at 8 feeds than 24, potentially due to screen brightness differences. Overall, results suggest that tunnel traffic control room operators may be able to monitor up to 24 feeds while maintaining good performance and experiencing no substantial changes in mental workload when only two distinct scenes are displayed. This highlights the importance of the complexity of visual information alongside feed count alone.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Schlimme, Léon D.",June 2025,English,"No.

This study investigates how Dutch secondary school students experience and manage uncertainty during collaborative inquiry-based learning within a digital climate simulation lab (Go-Lab). Drawing on Jordan’s (2010) uncertainty management framework and the inquiry learning cycle model by Pedaste et al. (2015), the study analyzes 47 student chat episodes to identify the types and management strategies of uncertainty encountered. Four types of uncertainties emerged: Uncertainties related to the learning environment, course content, task assignment, and interpersonal relationships. Students predominantly employed a reducing strategy to manage these uncertainties, though instances of maintaining, ignoring, and increasing uncertainty were also observed, varying across different phases of the inquiry cycle. The inquiry process of investigation elicited the most uncertainty, especially related to the learning environment. Findings highlight the value of collaborative uncertainty dialogue significance and supported inquiry-based learning environments in promoting productive uncertainty management.

In the game, players care for spirits and guide them to the afterlife while engaging with themes surrounding death. The narrative, characters, and gameplay mechanics encourage meaningful reflection on mortality. The game explores death positively, inspired by encounters with patients, caregivers, and personal stories. Experiential Learning Theory is used as a lens to analyse how participants reflected on mortality through a structured process of experiencing, reflecting, conceptualising, and potentially applying their insights.
Materials and methods: A qualitative approach was used, combining diary studies and semi-structured interviews with 11 players who each played the game for around 25 hours. The diary entries provided insight into participants’ thoughts and feelings, while the interviews allowed for an opportunity to reflect more after finishing the game.
Results: Participants often shared feeling emotional connections to in-game characters and gaining new insights. Some participants shared they experienced a shift in their perspective on mortality, while others maintained their existing beliefs or found that their beliefs were reinforced.
Conclusion: This study contributes to the exploration of how digital games can result in meaningful reflective experiences. It highlights that games like Spiritfarer are able to facilitate emotional and philosophical engagement with complex themes such as death through narrative engagement and eudaimonic elements. These findings support the potential for digital games to serve as tools for eudaimonic experiences and meaningful reflection.",Master Communication Science (M-COM),"Wee, Nienke van der",June 2025,English,"No

This study contributed to this shift by examining how different evidence disclosure timings and suspect guilt influence the amount of investigation-relevant information disclosed and how mentally demanding the interview becomes for the suspect. To do so, we employed a 2 (guilty vs. innocent) x 2 (late vs. gradual) between-participants design. Participants (n = 93) took part in an in-person mock police interview and were instructed to convince the interviewer of their innocence. Results showed that innocent suspects disclosed significantly more investigation-relevant information than guilty suspects, and that gradual evidence disclosure elicited more investigation-relevant information than late disclosure. An interaction effect between suspect guilt and evidence disclosure timing was near significance, suggesting that the benefits of the gradual disclosure may be driven primarily by innocent suspects. Guilty suspects reported higher levels of cognitive load than innocent suspects, while disclosure timing had no significant effect on cognitive load, nor was cognitive load associated with the amount of disclosed investigation-relevant information. These findings support the effectiveness of the gradual evidence disclosure for eliciting investigation-relevant information from cooperative suspects and challenge accounts that suggest cognitive load as the primary mechanism for explaining differences in suspect behaviours.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Moreitz, Moritz L.",June 2025,English,"No.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted in which participants (N = 178) completed validated questionnaires measuring gaslighting acceptance and ACEs. Spearman’s rank correlations were conducted between gaslighting acceptance scores and total ACE scores, as well as on the item-level. While results indicated no significant correlation between total ACE scores and gaslighting acceptance scores, different specific types of ACEs were negatively associated, with sexual abuse remaining statistically significant after correction for multiple testing (Spearman’s N  = -.21). These findings suggest that cumulative childhood adversity scores are not predictive of gaslighting acceptance, but that certain types of ACEs may sensitize individuals to avoid gaslighting.

106623,Navigating Proportionality and Privacy : A Case Study of Technology Use in EU Border Management Systems,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106623,"The increasing adoption of technological and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems by public and governmental organizations raises concerns about the protection of fundamental and privacy rights of individuals. Especially, within the migration and border control sector, more technologies are being implemented to enhance the efficiency of migration processes. However, research shows that the fundamental rights of migrants are being harmed due to criminalization, discrimination, and increased surveillance (Amnesty International, 2024). As a results, the European Union (EU) has established regulations that govern data processing activities to safeguard the privacy rights of individuals. One of the most important principles governing these data processing activities is the principle of proportionality. However, concerns have increased regarding privacy rights due to the increasing data processing regulations, such as the principle of proportionality. As they try to increase privacy protection, it is often seen by public and governmental organizations as difficult to understand and how to implement in practice effectively. This study examines to what extent and how the principle of proportionality is included within the most relevant EU regulations and what gaps may exist that could harm privacy rights. Therefore, the research aims to provide policy recommendations and practical insights for public governmental organizations on how to implement and ensure proportionality standards when utilizing technological (AI) systems when processing personal data to protect privacy rights. The primary research question guiding this study is: To what extent and how is proportionality embedded in the EU regulatory framework and how can it be enhanced to better align with public organizations' expectations and privacy protection when using (AI) technologies in border management?
A qualitative research design was applied, combining a comprehensive literature review on legal requirements and a policy analysis on the EU regulatory framework combined with semi- structured interviews among relevant public governmental organizations, privacy experts, and humanitarian organizations. The results reveal that the principle of proportionality is formally embedded within the EU regulations, however, it lacks practical understanding and guidance. Moreover, requirements within the regulations are inconsistently applied, causing less deep ethical considerations when deploying technological (AI) systems. To address the main policy and practical gaps, a proportionality assessment and policy recommendations have been developed to safeguard privacy rights of migrants within the EU migration and border control sector in the future when using (AI) technologies.",Master European Studies (M-ES),"Broeknellis, Hannah Josephina",June 2025,English,"No

106621,The risk of developing lung cancer after breast cancer,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106621,"Background:
Second primary lung cancer (SPLC) is a serious long-term complication among breast cancer survivors, with limited knowledge on how treatment characteristics influence this risk. This study aimed to assess associations between breast cancer treatments and SPLC risk, and to compare tumor characteristics of SPLCs in breast cancer survivors with those of primary lung cancer in women without a history of cancer. Methods:
All women newly diagnosed with breast cancer between 2005 and 2020 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Breast cancer patients were grouped into four cohorts based on year of diagnosis and cancer being either invasive or in situ. Multivariate logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards models, and a competing risk Cox model were used to assess associations between patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics and the risk of SPLC. In addition, all women diagnosed with primary lung cancer or SPLC between 2010 and 2023 were selected to compare tumor characteristics between SPLCs and primary lung cancers. Lung tumor characteristics were compared between breast cancer survivors with SPLC and women diagnosed with a primary lung tumor without a history of cancer. Results:
Increased risk of SPLC was observed among women aged 50-74 years compared to those under 50 years, although this association was not consistent for patients aged 75+. Lower socioeconomic status and HR-/HER2- breast tumor receptor status were linked to higher risk of SPLC, while stage III breast tumors and multifocal breast tumors were associated with decreased risk. In the 2010-2020 invasive cohort, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were associated with reduced risk of SPLC. These findings were largely confirmed in Cox regression. The competing risk Cox model confirmed that older patients had higher mortality before SPLC, highlighting the importance of accounting for competing events. Compared to women with primary lung cancer, SPLCs in breast cancer survivors were more frequently located in the upper lobe and diagnosed at an earlier stage. Conclusion:
This study shows that certain patient characteristics, breast tumor characteristics, and treatment characteristics are associated with the risk of developing SPLC in breast cancer survivors. Differences were found in tumor location and stage at diagnosis between SPLCs and primary lung cancers.",Master Health Sciences (M-HS),"Nagtegaal, Sophie",June 2025,English,"No

Research in the failure of kinematic couplings does not focus on the conjunction of compliance and friction. While aligning the contact points do not all make contact at the same time. If the same order of contact would be used during alignment, this can improve the repeatability. This effect is especially useful for asymmetric couplings, since different contact orders lead to different values of repeatability. In this thesis a two-dimensional model is introduced to predict the virtual play based on both compliance and friction. This leads to a better understanding of the working principle of kinematic couplings. A second model shows the effect of alignment approaches on the initial positioning.

One such solution is the creation of energy communities, citizen led groups focusing on consumption of renewable energy. The current study analysed whether environmental identity of individuals influenced their intention to join an energy community, and whether need for achievement moderated the relationship. Need for achievement was derived from McClelland’s theory of needs (McClelland, 1985). Environmental identity was manipulated with the Ease of Retrieval task, based on the work of Schwarz et al., (1991). The study employed an experimental design, manipulating the identity using an ease of retrieval task with recall of two or 12 past environmental behaviours. Ease of retrieval was found to be unsuccessful in manipulating identity, meanwhile environmental identity and need for achievement alone positively predicted intention to join an energy community. No moderating effect of the need for achievement was found. The findings could be explained by the nature of environmental identity, specificity of the ease of retrieval task, independent effect of need for achievement and small sample size.

Wearable technology such as the CardioWatch, developed by the DETECT research group, may support early detection. This study aimed to develop a standardised and reproducible protocol to simulate OHCA in healthy young adults. Four healthy volunteers each performed 20 simulated cardiac arrest scenarios, varying in position (sitting, lying, standing), fall type (sudden, gentle, arm only), occlusion method (blood pressure cuff, tourniquet), and simulated convulsions. The CardioWatch collected photoplethysmography (PPG) and accelerometer data. Simulations were evaluated using five predefined PPG criteria; those meeting at least four were considered realistic. Out of 80 measurements, 52 met the criteria. The blood pressure cuff was more consistent and comfortable than the tourniquet, especially in sitting and lying positions. Standing scenarios only met the criteria when 100 mmHg above the systolic pressure was used. Walking and convulsions introduced significant signal artefacts. Falls onto the watch resulted in misleading data. In conclusion, the blood pressure cuff was the most effective method for simulating OHCA. Six scenarios were selected, forming a practical protocol that can serve as a foundation for the first part of the DETECT-4 study.",Bachelor Technical Medicine (B-TG),"Greebe, Daan, Delden, Reinout van, Verbist, Esmee, Funcke, Chantall",June 2025,English,"No.

106612,Systems Architecting in Railway Signalling : Bridging legacy yard signalling systems with ERTMS,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106612,"This thesis investigates the development of a future-proof, capability-enhancing architecture for Dutch 
railway signalling systems in yards, facilitating the transition from legacy systems to the European Rail 
Traffic Management System (ERTMS). To provide the necessary context for this study, Chapter 1 starts with 
an introduction to ProRail, the organisation responsible for managing the Dutch railway infrastructure. 
This is accompanied by a brief explanation of how to perform railway signalling and the required hardware, 
ensuring safe and efficient train operations.
Chapter 2 presents a systems engineering approach that is adopted in the research. It emphasises the use 
of reverse architecting to understand the existing legacy systems and the employment of the Department 
of Defence Architecture Framework (DoDAF) to develop a future-proof architectural description. The 
research extracts architecture knowledge and applies various systems engineering tools to abstract and 
present the architectural information, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the legacy systems 
and their interfaces.
The research findings in Chapter 3 give an overview of the challenges associated with legacy railway 
signalling systems, including high life cycle costs, electromagnetic compatibility issues, and the limited 
availability of skilled labour. This chapter provides context for the argument that standardisation and 
modularisation can enhance system capabilities and lower life cycle costs.
While Chapter 3 investigates the present situation, Chapter 4 takes a further look into the future, 
representing the development of ERTMS-specific signalling systems. It examines the potential advantages 
and disadvantages of integrating ERTMS Level 1 train protection into legacy systems, promising to 
enhance interoperability and thereby make the railway infrastructure future-proof.
As a result, Chapter 5 presents the outcome of the design goal, which is an architecture referred to as 
the Bridging Architecture. It highlights the importance of transitioning to ERTMS specifications to achieve 
long-term improvements in safety, efficiency, and interoperability within the Dutch railway network. The 
design outcome introduces increased capabilities of legacy hardware by deploying standardised, modular 
signalling systems on yards in a distributed manner.
The findings in this thesis provide valuable insights into the architectural design and implementation 
strategies that can support the future development of railway signalling systems. Reflection upon the 
design research outcomes is discussed in Chapter 6. This involves the study’s results, as well as the 
approaches and processes used.
Chapter 7 concludes the thesis and highlights the key findings of this research. This chapter also addresses 
the design question and its sub-questions. Lastly, Chapter 8 provides actionable suggestions and outlines

However, existing UAV datasets are very limited, especially aerial data with vehicle annotations are rare and the coverage of the scene is narrow, which hinders the improvement of the performance of data-driven deep learning models. To address these issues, a semi-automated process is proposed to reconstruct a real outdoor scene, acquire and generate synthetic training data with annotations, and use these data to train deep learning models to improve their vehicle speed estimation performance. Our process is divided into four main steps: scene reconstruction, data acquisition and annotation, model training, and testing and comparing model performance. This method uses synthetic data to overcome the limitations of real data by enriching the training samples with realistic synthetic images and highly accurate annotations. Such synthetic images have been proved that they can significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of the model. In our experiments, models trained with synthetic datasets generalise well to real UAV videos, while models pre-trained with real datasets and fine-tuned with synthetic datasets have further improved performance. The results show that synthetic data can improve the accuracy of detection and speed estimation of deep learning models.",Master Geo-information Science and Earth Observation (M-GEO-WO),"Song, Yaozheng",June 2025,English,"No

Participants completed pre- and post-measures for attitude and concern; realism was assessed post-manipulation. VR participants reported significantly more positive attitudes than the text group, suggesting that immersion – presumably via stronger affective engagement – can intensify moral evaluations even in an unfamiliar domain. Concern increased among all participants, regardless of condition. Perceived realism remained relatively low and did not differ between conditions, but it did act as a moderator: higher perceived realism strengthened the impact of VR on attitude. Analysis of open-ended responses further showed that content coherence and personal relevance are crucial for credibility. Together, the results suggest that immersive media can influence moral attitudes provided that scenario content and context are credible.

This research presents a practical and time-efficient rescheduling model to mitigate such disruptions for 5-axis machines within a flexible machining cell. The model combines a best-fit insertion strategy and an event-based approach using expanding time windows. Four best-fit methods were developed to balance tardiness and schedule stability, with the ""similar timeslot"" method proving most effective in HTM Aerotec’s context. To limit computation time, the algorithm progressively expands the rescheduling scope based on the disruption duration, employing a percentage-based time window expansion strategy. Experimental validation with real production data across 30 disruption scenarios showed that the model produces feasible schedules within a 60-second runtime, achieving up to 75% utilisation when disruptions occur early. While it cannot match the theoretical efficiency of the original schedule, the model achieves target production times. The model is generalisable to other flexible machining environments and integrates with HTM Aerotec’s ERP and fixture databases.

106602,Organization and Goals of Virtual Care Centres in Dutch Hospitals,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106602,"Background: Virtual care involves remote patient monitoring and digital communication between 
patients and providers and is increasingly integrated into healthcare. In Dutch hospitals, virtual 
care centres (VCCs) have emerged to provide all digital care services through a centralized 
department. This approach aims to address healthcare challenges, such as staff shortages, 
rising costs, and the need for accessible, high-quality care. While VCCs are rapidly developing, 
little is known about how they are organized and what goals they pursue. This study aimed to 
explore the structural organization and goals of VCCs in the Netherlands.
Methods: To gain broad insight into the current organization and goals of VCCs in Dutch hospitals, 
an online survey combining qualitative and quantitative questions was conducted. The survey, 
developed based on the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist, 
was distributed to all 69 Dutch hospitals between May and June 2025. Inclusion criteria ensured 
respondents had knowledge of their hospital’s virtual care approach and proficiency in Dutch.
Quantitative data from multiple choice and numeric questions were summarized using 
descriptive statistics, including frequencies, percentages, means and medians. Qualitative data 
from open-ended fields were analyzed through coding and categorizing responses related to 
organizational structure and goals. Additionally, correlation analyses were conducted to explore 
relationships between variables of interest.
Results: Of the 37 hospitals included in the analysis (54% of all Dutch hospitals), 15 (41%) 
reported operating a virtual care centre (VCC). The structural organization of these VCCs included 
common use of digital applications for remote patient monitoring, with nearly all centres using 
phone calls, in-app messaging, and automated messages to communicate with patients. 
(Specialized) nurses were the primary providers of virtual care. Most hospitals provided training 
to VCC staff and offered patients support in using monitoring technology. Virtual care pathways 
were mostly disease-specific, developed by multidisciplinary teams, and typically initiated by 
medical specialists. Integration with electronic medical records varied across VCCs. The number 
of full-time equivalent staff (FTEs), average monthly patient volumes, number of care pathways, 
collaborations with external partners, and financing sources showed variation among VCCs. 
Regarding goals, nearly all VCCs reported ambitions to expand virtual care services, improve 
collaboration, and scale up capacity. All VCCs used patient and staff feedback to evaluate virtual 
care delivery.
Conclusions: The Dutch hospitals showed alignment on several organizational aspects of their 
VCCs, including technology type, communication channels, implementation of care pathways, 
and technical support, though the level of technological infrastructure varied. Most hospitals 
expressed ambitions to expand virtual care, enhance regional collaboration, and scale up their 
VCCs, reflecting alignment with national digital healthcare goals. These findings provide a basis 
for hospitals and policymakers to further develop VCCs, with a focus on enhancing technological 
integration, optimizing resource allocation, strengthening external collaborations and improving 
financial support.",Master Health Sciences (M-HS),"Balm, Jessica",June 2025,English,"No

106600,"Evaluating the Impact of Evidence Disclosure Techniques and Suspect Status on Rapport, Trust, and Information Sharing during Suspect Interviews",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106600,"One of the most challenging forms of investigative interviews is interviewing suspects. To optimise interviewer competence, it is important to examine variables that influence interview outcomes. For instance, the interviewer can use different techniques to disclose evidence to the suspect. Although these techniques have been studied in relation to detecting deception, their effects on rapport, trust, and information sharing remain largely unexplored. Moreover, the role of the suspect's status, innocent or guilty, can also influence these outcomes. This research examines how evidence disclosure techniques and suspect status affect rapport, trust, and information sharing during suspect interviews. The study involved an interactive mock crime scenario, followed by a scripted face-to-face suspect interview, and concluded with post-interview questionnaires. To analyse the results, a 2x2 between-subjects design was used. Students from the University of Twente (N = 93) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions. The findings suggest that when evidence is disclosed gradually (TUE), suspects are likely to share more information, which can contribute to generating leads and continuing investigations in law enforcement. Additionally, innocent participants reported higher levels of rapport and shared more information than guilty participants, indicating that suspect status affected how participants perceived the interaction and their cooperation.",Bachelor Psychology (B-PSY),"Bovendeerd, L.",June 2025,English,"No

106594,The Impact of Hope and Fear Appeals in Video Content on Promoting Sustainable Tourism Behaviour,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106594,"The tourism industry remains a key driver of economic growth, while also posing persistent challenges to environmental sustainability. Tourists often engage in less sustainable behavior during vacations than in their daily lives. This study examines how emotional framing in short video content on social media influences tourists' pro-environmental intentions. Drawing on the Extended Parallel Process Model, it analyzes the effects of fear and hope appeals, with self-efficacy as a moderator and sustainable behavior at home as a control variable.
A quantitative experiment was conducted with 237 tourists in Valencia, Spain. Participants were randomly assigned to one of eight conditions in a 2 × 2 × 2 between-subjects design. The experimental videos varied in emotional framing and the inclusion of efficacy cues, followed by a survey measuring behavioral intentions. The results showed that neither fear nor hope appeals significantly increased pro-environmental intentions. Self-efficacy did not significantly moderate these effects. However, prior sustainable behavior at home was a strong predictor of intentions to behave sustainably while traveling.
These findings suggest that emotional video messaging alone may have limited impact in tourism contexts, where psychological distancing and leisure-oriented goals may weaken message effectiveness.

106593,Unlocking Individual Performance : Exploring the Role of Team Communication Platforms in Multi-Team Membership,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106593,"Multiple Team Membership (MTM) is an increasingly common practice that offers benefits such as enhanced knowledge transfer and flexible resource allocation. However, it also introduces challenges, including coordination difficulties, attention fragmentation, and cognitive overload for individuals. Although Team Communication Platforms (TCPs) are often developed to address some of these challenges, their specific impact on individual performance (IP) within MTM contexts remains underexplored. Existing literature usually focuses on specific technologies or team-level dynamics, overlooking the individual-level implications.
This thesis aims to bridge this gap by investigating how the utilization of TCPs moderates the relationship between MTM and IP. Drawing on the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) theory, this study explores how TCPs utilization might mitigate MTM’s demands and enhance its resources. The study employed a quantitative, cross-sectional design, utilizing survey data collected from 219 professionals. The data were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression to test the hypotheses. We uncovered an unexpected U-shaped relationship between MTM and both IP.
This suggests an initial dip in performance with increasing team involvement, likely due to coordination challenges, followed by an improvement at higher MTM levels as individuals develop coping mechanisms and efficiency. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the moderating role of TCPs utilization in this relationship was not supported, potentially because their demands (e.g., notifications) offset their resource benefits when individuals take part in multiple teams simultaneously.
However, TCPs utilization and the utilization of specific features demonstrated a direct positive impact on individual performance, particularly on contextual performance. In practical terms, organizations should anticipate initial dips in performance when individuals participate in multiple teams simultaneously and focus on providing robust support during early MTM experiences. Furthermore, organizations should continue to encourage the use of TCPs for their direct benefits on individual performance.

106590,A valuation blueprint for Software-as-a-Service startups,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106590,"Akela Hub is a Dutch Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) startup that spun out from the Unknown 
Group in early 2024. Operating with a SaaS revenue business model, Akela Hub faces a 
common challenge among early-stage startups: determining the value of the startup. Traditional 
valuation methods, such as Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) or market comparables, often fall 
short for startups like Akela Hub due to their limited financial history, intangible asset structure, 
and high growth uncertainty. This resulted in the following research question:
How can a valuation blueprint for Akela Hub be developed and applied to address the 
limitations of traditional valuation methods and support strategic decision-making for exit 
strategies?
To address this, we developed a lifecycle-based SaaS valuation blueprint through a combination 
of literature research, expert validation, and regression analyses. The blueprint utilises Annual 
Recurring Revenue (ARR) as a proxy to categorise startup stages and offers tailored metrics 
and valuation methods for each stage. Additionally, two Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) 
models, using exit data from acquisitions and Initial Public Offerings (IPO), further revealed 
valuation insights. For example, acquisitions in North America tend to yield a valuation 
approximately 21% higher than in Europe, and the valuation of an IPO exit increases over time 
due to company maturity, even when funding is held constant.
Applying the blueprint to Akela Hub, the company was classified in the seed stage. As a result, 
the VC method was used to estimate the valuation under different growth scenarios, resulting 
in a current valuation range of €2,900,000 to €20,100,000. Although this is a broad range, it 
reflects the expected uncertainty of early-stage forecasting.",Bachelor Industrial Engineering & Management Science (B-IEM),"Mulder, R.L.M.",June 2025,English,"No

106589,Rebuilding Consumers’ Trust Towards Green Products Hindered by Greenwashing Practices : A Qualitative Study,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106589,"Nowadays, greenwashing practices are gaining popularity due to the fact that companies tend more and more to use sustainability as a marketing tool. Thus, it is scientifically proven that the trust of environmentally aware consumers is negatively affected by these type of practices. This research investigates how trust of environmentally aware consumers, originating from three European countries, with different levels of income, can effectively be rebuilt post greenwashing. A qualitative methodology based on interviews has been chosen with the purpose of gathering in-depth insights into consumers’ perspectives. The model of trust rebuilding created by Xie and Peng (2009) that divides the efforts of trust rebuilding among affective, informational and functional is used a theoretical framework for this study. Based on the findings, the model is adapted to fit the specific context of rebuilding trust post greenwashing. The findings disclose that it is not an easy job for corporations to restore the trust levels of the consumers. Affective efforts such as apology messages are imperative to be made as a first step towards change. Furthermore, functional efforts such as building a concrete corrective plan of action, informational efforts such as being transparent in communication or having a third-party green certification and organisational efforts such as leadership changes are very important factors that reduces consumers’ skepticism and help them to slowly rebuild their trust in eco-friendly companies. However, long-term commitment of the company to the change is also a very important aspect to maintain an increasing trend of the trust level. Also, financial compensation has a negative effect in this context because personal values of environmentally aware consumers dictate their actions and purchasing behaviour. Thus, considering the fact that this category of consumers are not driven by monetary gain, financial compensation is seen as way to buy their trust rather than restoring it. Based on the identified factors that have demonstrated their effectiveness in the context of greenwashing, actionable practices are recommended to companies that are aiming to recover the trust of the individuals and position themselves again as a credible sustainability actor that acts in the best interests of the environmentally aware consumers.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Stoian, V.G.",June 2025,English,"No.

Using the Ease of Retrieval (EoR) technique to manipulate EI, and McClelland’s Theory of Needs to test for a moderating effect of the Need for Affiliation, an experimental between-groups design was applied (n = 107). Participants were assigned to either an easy or difficult recall condition. The EoR manipulation did not alter the perception of EI, comparing both recall conditions. However, EI was found to be a significant predictor of intention to join an EC. However, no moderating effect of the Need for Affiliation was found.

106584,Development of Limb : Extending the Functionality of the RELbot for the MSc-Robotics Specialisation Mechatronics and Physical AI.,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106584,"This project presents the design of a manipulator add-on for the educational robotic mobile platform named the RELbot to add kinematic and dynamic complexity to the system. This would allow the RELbot system to be used in more mechatronics-oriented courses of the MSc-Robotics program.
A 2DOF RR robotic arm was developed with a modular control stack, dividing the control of the system into three distinct components which can be implemented by the user. An accompanying model of the system was developed within 20-sim, which allows for safe and remote testing and development of these control components.
Additional safety checks were built into the system to guarantee safe operation for the user independent of the users’ implementation of the control components.
Implementation testing shows that the manipulator is capable of accurately and smoothly moving between end effector waypoints, with an average tracking error of 3.2mm without end effector load, and an average tracking error of 6.2mm with a 100g load.
The manipulator shows the promising potential in educations applications due to the high level of modularity it provides, especially for courses related to the design of control systems or system identification theory.",Master Robotics (M-ROB),"Heelsum, Jetze van",June 2025,English,"No

106583,"Poelsbeek as a future proof area, considering both the droughts and wet periods",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106583,"This report aims to develop a redesign strategy to prepare for both droughts and
excess water by using groundwater levels as a guiding factor. The approach is applied to
the pilot area of Poelsbeek and can potentially be replicated in other regions. By outlining
a method to assess and adapt areas based on groundwater behavior, this research provides
a framework for other, and potentially larger, applications.
First, the current functioning of the Poelsbeek area was analyzed, identifying design
weaknesses by determining threshold and optimal groundwater levels. These values were
mapped against present groundwater depths to highlight vulnerable zones. The analysis
was extended to include scenarios with increased and decreased groundwater levels due to
climate change, allowing for a comparison between current and future vulnerabilities and
emphasizing the need for redesign.
Next, several interventions were assessed for their potential to influence groundwater
levels. After applying these interventions and simulating new groundwater conditions, the
same thresholds and optimal values were used to reassess area vulnerability. This revealed
which zones remained furthest from their ideal groundwater conditions and which did not
meet the required levels.
The study concluded that land use significantly affects groundwater depth through its
impact on evapotranspiration. Therefore, the most effective redesign combines changing
agricultural land use, replacing crops with spinach and kale, and reducing the depth of the
drainage pipe from 70 to 48 cm. This combined intervention provides the most promising
results for climate-adaptive water management in the area of Poelsbeek.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Frankema, Jelmer",June 2025,English,"No.

106582,The Design and Evaluation of a Wrench Observer to Estimate the Disturbance Wrench Using Wearable Sensors,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106582,"This study presents the design and validation of a wrench observer for estimating external disturbances acting on a standing human body using data from wearable sensors. The observer is based on biomechanical models and sensor measurements, both of which are sources of inaccuracy. The primary goal of this research is to analyze how such inaccuracies affect the estimated disturbance wrench to assess the oberver's performance. The observer was first evaluated in a simulation environment using a simplified human body model. This allowed for controlled anlaysis of the system's sensitivity to various parameters. Following this, an experimental validation was performed to examine the oberver's performance in more realistic scenario's. The proposed mathematical framework for the wrench observer demonstrated a working concept. Several parmeters were identified which have a high senstivity on the accuracy of the disturbance estimation. In the experimental validation, the observer showed promising results in estimating linear disturbances. However, the estimation of angular disturbances remains a challenge for furter improvment. Overall, this research lays a foundation for the development of a disturbance wrench observer. However, further refinement of the implementation and calibration of the wearable sensors is necessary. Additionally, future work should focus on implementing methods that improve the estimation of person-specific body parameters, which are crucial for accurately defining the underlying biomechanical models.",Master Mechanical Engineering (M-ME),"Rabou, Nicole",June 2025,English,"No.

Using a mixed-method approach, in which facial expressions of participants were detected using the iMotions software while the participants watched selected advertisements from the popular cosmetic brands Dove and Rare Beauty, which included storytelling and brand personality elements, followed by in-depth interviews. The findings show that storytelling evoked stronger emotional responses, when it was perceived as authentic and relatable. It evoked feelings of joy, which are highly associated with brands’ warmth, competence, and trustworthiness. Brand personality was only effective when it was perceived as sincere. Emotional responses worked as mediators between the branding approaches and brand perception.

However, time delays in communication channels still degrade performance and can cause instability. This thesis investigates how time delays affect system behaviour and whether performance can be improved through compensation. Three research questions were addressed: how the P-P architecture behaves under ideal conditions; how time delays impact system dynamics; and whether a feedforward compensation term mitigates adverse effects. Under ideal conditions, positions and forces behave predictably, though the remote robot does not perfectly track the operator due to system dynamics. With time delays, the system first behaves energy dissipative, then transitions to energy generative behaviour beyond a critical threshold, depending on the time delay and input frequency. To counteract this, a compensation term based on the parasitic force caused by time delay was introduced. While this improves force alignment, it also removes dissipative behaviour that had previously supported passivity. Particularly in dynamic environments, such as a virtual wall, delayed feedback can introduce energy generative behaviour.",Master Systems and Control (M-SC),"Kareem, L.",June 2025,English,"No.

106578,Functional Connectivity Changes in the Primary Motor Cortex Induced by Dual-Site Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation : A Source-Level Analysis,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106578,"Background: Functional connectivity (FC) plays an essential role in motor control and is often disrupted in
neurological disorders. Dual-site transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (ds-tACS) is a method used to
modulate FC between different brain regions, such as the left and right Primary Motor Cortices (M1s). A key
parameter of ds-tACS is the phase-lag of the stimulation waveform between the stimulation sites, determining
if the applied stimulation synchronizes or desynchronizes the underlying regions. This study tested the hypothesis that ds-tACS modulates interhemispheric FC in a phase-specific manner. This study investigated how four
different phase-lags affect the FC between left and right M1 in source space. A secondary aim was to investigate
how different averaging methods of wPLI values of source pairs influence the detection of ds-tACS induced FC
changes.
Methods: Resting-state EEG data was analysed from a preliminary dataset of 25 participants, of which 20
participants were included, after receiving ds-tACS at 20Hz with four phase-lag conditions: InPhase, PiHalf,
AntiPhase, 3HalfPi, and a sham condition. Source reconstruction was performed using the eLORETA algorithm. FC was quantified using the weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI) for the beta-band (13-30Hz). To
assess phase-specific FC modulation, both global averaging and Hierarchical Clustering (HCC) were applied
on post-stimulation wPLI values, with and without anatomical constraints based on whether sources were spatially adjacent to each other. HCC clustering with anatomical constraints was also applied to the pre-stimulus
recording to ensure fixed clustering between participants, conditions and segments. Statistical significance was
assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank and the Hermans-Rasson test.
Results: Using global averaging, no significant modulation of FC was found after Bonferroni correction. However, when using anatomically constrained HCC, the PiHalf condition increased FC compared to Sham and other
active conditions across multiple cluster combinations. In contrast, the InPhase condition showed a decrease in
FC. This behaviour also showed when analyzing the data with fixed clustering. The adjusted Rand Index (ARI)
found low clustering consistency for HCC without anatomical constraints (0.02), but increased when anatomical
constraints were applied (0.2). Fixed clustering showed ARI values of 0.15 for the left hemisphere and 0.07 for
the right hemisphere.
Conclusions: This preliminary study demonstrated that ds-tACS at 20Hz, applied to the M1s, modulated
FC, with PiHalf increasing and InPhase decreasing FC. The limited sensitivity of global averaging approaches
suggests the importance of spatially informed clustering techniques. Anatomically constrained HCC improved
clustering consistency, but further methodological improvements are needed.",Master Biomedical Engineering (M-BME),"Hagen, Joris Johannes",June 2025,English,"No

106577,Emerging Roles and Competences in Innovation Procurement in Intramural Healthcare,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106577,"Purpose:
This study identifies skill profiles for specific healthcare innovation procurement 
situations by uncovering emerging roles through expert interviews and mapping 
required competencies via the ProcurCompEU Framework. It contributes to 
procurement competency literature by applying this framework in a healthcare-specific academic context, paving the way for future research. The identified 
roles and competencies can support training future healthcare procurers and 
developing procurement departments.
Methodology:
21 experts in the field of healthcare innovation procurement were interviewed, 
after which interview were transcribed and analysed. The study applied a 
combination of inductive thematic analysis for the identification of future roles 
and deductive analysis for investigating each role’s associated ProcurCompEU
competences. 
Most important findings:
Six future roles and associated ProcurCompEU competences were identified: 
Strategic Business Partner (SBP), Digital/Automation Expert (D/AE), Innovation 
Matchmaker, Sustainability Coordinator, Data Engineer, and Innovation 
Coordinator. Each role possesses distinct competency requirements, with four 
competences being identified as fundamental and necessary for all roles due to 
innovation procurement’s explorative and uncertain nature.
Conclusions and main recommendations:
Innovation sourcing in intramural healthcare requires strategically differentiated 
procurement roles with distinct competencies. Healthcare organisations are 
advised to adopt tailored versions of the six identified roles, adapted to their 
specific organisational objectives and context. The associated competency 
profiles offer practical guidance for role development, recruitment, and training to 
better support innovation efforts.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Lefers, L.G.",June 2025,English,"No

106575,Explanation Guided Learning for Sports Video Data,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106575,"Deep Neural Networks achieve high accuracy in human activity recognition but often lack transparency, hindering trust in applications like automated sports officiating. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to elucidate model decisions, while Explanation Guided Learning (EGL) seeks to improve model intuition by incorporating explanations into training. This thesis investigates the efficacy of EGL for activity diving recogntion. We propose and evaluate novel EGL methodologies that leverage optical flow to automatically generate ground truth attention maps, addressing the common EGL challenge of reliance on manual annotations. Our methods include: 1) an Optical Flow Guided Learning (OGL) approach using a Dice loss to align model-generated GradCAM attention with optical flow-derived diver silhouettes; 2) an OGL approach that directly transforms input frames using these diver masks (Temporal Mask Transform); and 3) a ""Right for the Right Reason"" (RRR) loss guided by either GradCAM (RRR + GradCAM) or optical flow-derived attention maps to penalise misleading input gradients (RRR + OGL). These are implemented on a SlowFast network architecture. Results indicate varying effectiveness among EGL approaches. The Dice-based method underperformed, likely due to a fundamental mismatch between GradCAM's attention and binary segmentation masks. However, the Temporal Mask Transform method demonstrates 6.67\% improvement at the lowest temporal resolution, and the RRR approach guided by optical flow (RRR + OGL) showed significant improvements, outperforming other augmentation methods at higher temporal resolutions (4.70\% improvement). Experiments with denser temporal sampling in the SlowFast model's slow pathway challenged original architectural assumptions of the SlowFast architecture. Our combined approach performed better than prior work while using approximately 56.0\% fewer computations. This research demonstrates EGL's potential for enhancing diving action recognition, underscores the viability of optical flow as a source for ground truth attention maps.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Tomassen, Y.",June 2025,English,"No

To the author’s knowledge, it is the first cohesive model that connects these concepts within the entrepreneurial process. Drawing from entrepreneurship, branding, and design literature, the framework proposes involving customers with branding in the early stages. This early engagement serves a dual purpose: validating the market opportunity simultaneously with shaping the brand positioning. By combining product and brand development through joint consumer input sessions, start-ups can minimize resource use and increase efficiency, addressing common challenges like time and budget constraints. 
The framework was tested through a case study involving the start-up of an entrepreneur named Paul, resulting in the creation of the Revost brand and the design of the Lock and Load bicycle rack. By placing both the entrepreneur and the customer at the centre of the branding process, this thesis demonstrates that branding can be more than a post-launch marketing exercise, it can be a strategic driver of venture creation itself.",Master Industrial Design Engineering (M-IDE),"Smit, H.M.",June 2025,English,"No

Using a design science research approach, the model was iteratively constructed through a systematic literature review, expert interviews, and a case study. The revised model captures key dimensions such as process efficiency, cost reduction, error minimization, and organizational readiness. Its applicability was validated through the implementation of an RPA solution in a micro-sized freight forwarder, where a manual invoicing process was automated. The case demonstrated substantial efficiency gains, including a 72 percent reduction in weekly process time and over 99 percent reduction in time per invoice, at a fraction of the cost of manual labour. The findings confirm that even resource-constrained logistics SMEs can achieve measurable returns from lightweight RPA projects. The model serves both as a design guide and a tool for ex-ante and ex-post evaluation, contributing to theory on automation feasibility and offering practical value to decision-makers in similar organizational settings.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Ostroga, D.A.",June 2025,English,"No.

106507,Effect of Running Speed on Lower Leg Muscle Activation and Tibial Bone Load,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106507,"Running is a very popular sport, but it is also associated with a high incidence of lower extremity overuse injuries, with the tibia being the most commonly affected location. Gaining insight into tibial loading and its underlying contributors, such as muscle activation, can improve our understanding of the origins behind these injuries and support the development of effective prevention and intervention strategies. This study investigated the effect of running speed on tibial loading and muscle activation of the tibialis anterior, soleus, gastrocnemius medialis, and gastrocnemius lateralis during the stance and swing phases. 
Nine subjects ran intervals at four different speeds (8, 10, 12, and 14 km/h) on a force plate-instrumented treadmill, while data were simultaneously collected using a motion capture system, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and EMG electrodes. 
Statistical analysis using Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) showed that, internal muscle forces, external impact forces, and total tibial bone load (TBL) increased significantly (p < 0.005) with speed. For every 1 km/h increase, peak internal force rose by 0.156 ± 0.011 BW, external force by 0.050 ± 0.005 BW, and total TBL by 0.192 ± 0.016 BW. The ratio between internal and external forces increased with speed, while peak timing remained unaffected. 
Muscle activation increased significantly (p < 0.005) with running speed for all measured muscles. For every 1 km/h increase in speed, tibialis anterior activation increased by 0.107 ± 0.011, soleus by 0.059 ± 0.009, gastrocnemius lateralis by 0.101 ± 0.011, and gastrocnemius medialis by 0.041 ± 0.008. This indicates that the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius lateralis showed the largest relative increases, while the soleus and gastrocnemius medialis exhibited more moderate changes. 
Because internal muscle force and external impact force increase at different rates with running speed, their ratio is speed-dependent and shows an increase of 0.028 ± 0.006 per 1 km/h. This ratio could be used to estimate internal muscle forces alongside estimated external impact forces from wearable sensors, enabling an overall estimation of total tibial loading. Such an approach may facilitate easier and more accessible monitoring of loading in real-world settings and improve research into overuse injuries.",Master Biomedical Engineering (M-BME),"Koning, S.J. de",June 2025,English,"No

The current study explored the relationship between the acceptance of using gaslighting tactics in relationships and borderline personality traits, the potential moderating role of (low) level of self-esteem, and explored which gender is more accepting of using gaslighting tactics. In a cross‐sectional online survey, participants completed the 10-item Gaslighting Acceptance Scale, the Borderline Symptom List 23, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Contrary to expectations, borderline traits did not significantly explain gaslighting acceptance. However, men reported significantly higher gaslighting acceptance than women. The interaction between borderline traits and self-esteem did not reach significance. These findings indicate that acceptance of gaslighting tactics is more closely linked to gendered differences than to borderline personality pathology or global self-esteem.

Drawing on theories of consumer behaviour and sustainable innovation adoption, the study investigates the influence of five predictors: sensory expectations, sustainability beliefs, health perceptions, price sensitivity, and social influence. A quantitative survey (N = 152) was conducted among Dutch consumers, and the data were analysed using correlation analysis and multiple linear regression. The results show that sensory expectations, sustainability beliefs, health perceptions, and price sensitivity significantly predict willingness to try hybrid meat, with sensory and price emerging as the strongest factors. Social influence, in contrast, was not a significant predictor. The findings suggest that individual product-related beliefs play a more central role in shaping intent than external social cues.

Due to low standardisation and high project variability, procurement for these Long Lead Items (LLIs) is typically customer order-driven, potentially causing delays in manufacturing. To address this issue, this study assesses the extent to which forecast-driven procurement is feasible for generic LLIs through a case study using real-world data. The performance of statistical and advanced deep learning models is evaluated on erratic and lumpy demand. Results demonstrate that  the feasibility of forecasting generic LLI demand in HNL’s ETO production environment is mixed and highly dependent on the characteristics of the specific LLI. While several models achieved improved accuracy over a naive benchmark, their inability to anticipate irregular peak demands on some time series suggests that forecasting alone may not sufficiently support forecast-driven procurement.",Master Industrial Engineering and Management (M-IEM),"Groot, M.J.A. de",June 2025,English,"No

Design: a qualitative research design was applied using in-depth interviews and the GIOIA method. Setting & participants: ten physiotherapists from the Netherlands were interviewed, including those with a CLA, without a CLA and self-employed physiotherapists. Participants were selected based on type of employment to capture different perspectives. Results: physiotherapists without a CLA experience the highest work pressure caused by administrative tasks, unclear employment terms and limited employer support. This weakens their professional identity and could impact their quality of care. In contrast, physiotherapists working with CLA, who tend to have a stronger professional identity. They benefit from stronger job security, teamwork and organizational support. Self-employed physiotherapists stated high autonomy and job satisfaction, as well as a stronger professional identity. However, they continue to face challenges from insurers and systematic constraints. Conclusion: working conditions significantly shape both the professional identity and the perception of the quality of care among physiotherapists in the Netherlands. These effects differ depending on the type of physiotherapists. The strength of the professional identity of physiotherapists without CLA became weaker, whereas physiotherapists with CLA and self-employed viewed their professional identity as stronger. Due to the aging population and decline in physiotherapists, there are concerns about the future of the profession. Additionally, health insurers remain to have a major impact on the physiotherapy sector. Implementing a CLA could help address these challenges and could contribute to a more sustainable future for the profession. It is not a definitive solution; a systematic change is necessary. Contribution: this research contributes to theory and practices as it provides new insights into how working conditions shape professional identity and quality of care in the physiotherapy sector. It focuses on improvement of professional practices and better workplace policies for employers, managers and policymakers.

This time-consuming process leads to high labor costs and frequent rework due to design changes. The goal of this research was to optimize and automate the process to reduce estimation time to under 8 hours. Using the Managerial Problem-Solving Method and Task-Technology Fit framework, a new method was developed combining statistical and analytical models. Historical project data was used to calculate average cost factors, which were implemented into Mensink’s ERP system, Bouwmakers, through reusable “combinations.” These combinations calculate parts of the quote automatically based on key design variables such as wall length or floor area. Bouwmakers was selected as the preferred tool due to its integration, usability, and ability to centralize project data. While full implementation was limited by time, a detailed plan and prototype were delivered.

This thesis, conducted in collaboration with Marktlink, develops a predictive framework to estimate EBITDA solely from publicly available financial data. A sector-specific approach is applied to business services, wholesale, and construction, recognizing that financial structures differ significantly between industries. Using a dataset of Dutch and Belgian SMEs from the Orbis database, multiple regression and machine learning models (Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest, and XGBoost) are trained and evaluated. The best-performing model, XGBoost on log-transformed features, achieves a Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) as low as 4.35% and an accuracy of 85.93%. SHAP analysis highlights total assets, equity, and tangible fixed assets as key drivers of EBITDA. The models significantly outperform common rule-of-thumb benchmarks and are validated through cross-validation and economic consistency via a stylized DCF framework.

The rise of sustainable clothing offers a possible solution to this problem. However, the high price of sustainable clothing, resulting from higher quality materials and higher labour costs, often prevents consumers from buying it. This study investigated whether two different types of incentives (moral versus remunerative) could increase consumers’ switching intention and choice for sustainable clothing. In addition, it examined how appeal type and environmental concern moderated the effect of these incentives and how consumers made trade-offs between sustainability and other product attributes when choosing between garment options. This research employed a mixed-methods approach, combining a 2x2 between-subjects design with choice-based conjoint analysis. Findings suggested that incentives, regardless of type, can effectively motivate consumers to choose more sustainable options. However, the interaction between appeal type and incentives, as well as environmental concern and incentives, did not significantly influence the results. Importantly, the study highlighted that sustainable materials play a key role in consumers’ clothing choices, with participants willing to pay a premium for higher quality over average quality at a standard price.

106484,Optimizing Route Efficiency In Dry Bulk Logistics: Reducing Empty Kilometers,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106484,"This thesis concerns the optimization of route efficiency of transport company Nijhof Wassink, specifically within the Dry Bulk Logistics department. The primary focus is the minimization of empty kilometers. Secondary priorities include total travel distance, vehicle usage and time window penalties. To formally and mathematically introduce the problem tailored to this business context, a new VRP variant is formulated. This is the multi-depot pick-up and delivery problem with time windows and transfers, also referred to as MD-PDPTW-T. To optimize large scale routing problems, an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) is designed, consisting of a constructive heuristic and an improvement heuristic using destroy and repair operators. The results of the ALNS algorithm are compared to the planning based on historical data and the initial solution obtained with the construction heuristic. Results show that the ALNS outperforms the initial solution by 26% and historical planning by 10%. Practical contributions include establishing a foundation for a transition to automated planning tools and encouraging a shift toward optimizing vehicle utilization rather than empty kilometers.",Master Industrial Engineering and Management (M-IEM),"Nijhof, Esmee",June 2025,English,"Yes

106481,Evaluating Ordering Strategies For State Elimination,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106481,"State elimination is an algorithm which reduces the state space of a Markov chain to a minimum size, without affecting the probabilities, when calculating unbounded reachability properties. The resource consumption in terms of memory and processing is greatly affected by the order in which states are eliminated while the result stays the same. The goal is to identify an order which performs better than other orders before the elimination process starts. This thesis lists several orders for elimination which are present in existing research or implementations. These orders are evaluated against one another on several Markov Chains from other existing research using two metrics. Using the data gathered from this evaluation several novel elimination orders are presented and also evaluated. One of these novel orders, Heuristic2 , has the best result on one metric for eleven out of fourteen models and second best for the remaining three.

It is based on a quantitative research design with data from 151 respondents - 110 from Generation Z and 41 from the Baby Boomer generation - collected in an online survey. Gen Z perceives a higher value when influencer marketing is active. Conversely, baby boomers show stronger brand loyalty, suggesting that long-term trust and habits outweigh the influence of social media recommendations. The path from influencer marketing to increased brand equity through influencer credibility is similar for both age groups. However, influencer credibility does not effectively convey brand loyalty, as older consumers' loyalty is tied to long-term brand relationships rather than influencer recommendations. The results of the study show that Generation Z has a stronger connection to brands through influencer marketing, while Baby Boomers have stronger brand loyalty. Influencer credibility significantly mediated the relationship between influencer marketing and brand equity for both generations but not brand loyalty. No significant moderated mediation by age group was found, suggesting an increase in brand perception with influencer credibility.

An analytical line source CBF model is made and an experimental CBF case is conducted in the wind tunnel at the University of Twente. Both models focus on uncertainties arising from the microphone phased array, as well as from environmental factors such as background noise, which affects the Cross Spectral Matrix and the temperature during the beamforming process. The experimental case measures the sound power output of the turbulent boundary layer trailing edge noise generated by an airfoil, while the analytical model simulates it. The uncertainties are evaluated by perturbing variables within the beamforming algorithm. The perturbed variables that are related to the microphone array include the microphone phases, microphone sensitivities, microphone coordinates, and the array broadband distance. In addition to the microphone parameters, the environmental factors such as the temperature and the cross correlated spectral signals received from the microphones are also perturbed. The error bounds are then defined around the frequency range, allowing the uncertainty in the beamforming method to be quantified both analytically and experimentally. Results show that the microphone sensitivity is the dominant perturbation mechanism in the analytical model. Despite this, the uncertainty in the CBF output remained sufficiently small. Additionally, the results show that, in the experimental model, the dominant perturbation mechanisms were the cross spectral matrix and the array’s broadband distance perturbations, where both significantly impacted the CBF output. This work primarily develops an uncertainty quantification method and tool which will enhance the reliability of acoustic far field phased array beamforming results.

Each HRS must provide at least 1 tonne of gaseous hydrogen per day and include a 70 MPa dispenser. Meeting these targets requires a large expansion of the current HRS network, which still faces significant technical and economic challenges. One major bottleneck in hydrogen transport is pipelines. Due to the low density and high diffusivity of hydrogen, pressure variations during pipeline transport can be significant, especially during fast refuelling, when compressibility effects dominate. These conditions result in high flow velocities, making it difficult to accurately predict outlet pressure and temperature. This research investigated the following question: How can analytical, empirical, and numerical models be used to approximate hydrogen flow in pipelines of varying diameter, and to what extent are they suitable to predict pressure and temperature under measured inlet conditions?'' A selection of commonly used hydrogen pipeline diameters was studied. Experimental data was obtained using a custom-developed test setup, and subsequently compared to analytical, empirical and numerical models. Additionally, shadowgraph imaging was performed at pipeline outlets to visualise flow phenomena. The investigated analytical and empirical models included: The Darcy-Weisbach, Weymouth, Panhandle, isentropic flow, and Fanno flow equations. Furthermore, a correction on the isentropic flow equations using the Soave-Redlich Kwong equation of state was investigated. Numerical modelling was performed with the SU2 and OpenFOAM CFD codes. In conclusion, analytical and empirical models offer a fast and reasonably accurate means of estimating outlet conditions in many practical scenarios, particularly when applying Fanno and isentropic formulations. Although the numerical models did not provide a direct method for predicting outlet conditions in the cases considered, they yielded deeper insights into the overall flow behaviour within the pipe.",Master Mechanical Engineering (M-ME),"Drummen, L.C.M.",June 2025,English,"No

106469,Automatic Detection of Cardiac Conduction Times on the ECG and Risk Prediction for High-Grade AV Block in TAVI Patients: Towards Feasible At-Home Monitoring,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106469,"Introduction:
TAVI has become the main treatment for severe aortic stenosis in elderly patients. However, one of the most common complications is a risk of high-grade AV block due to destruction of the conduction system by the calcified valve. A high-grade AV block often requires a permanent pacemaker implantation. Predicting this complication based on conduction:
times of the ECG could enable safe next day discharge and at-home monitoring. This thesis explores the feasibility of at-home ECG monitoring for TAVI patients, develops an algorithm to automatically detect conduction times, and constructs a prediction model for the risk of high-grade AV block. Methodology, Results & Discussion:
Part I – The Feasibility of At-Home monitoring after TAVI: A study was conducted on the feasibility of at-home monitoring for TAVI patients receiving Kardia ECG devices by HartWacht in a cohort of 79 patients eligible for next day discharge. Although 68 patients submitted an ECG before TAVI, adherence to the full protocol (ECG recordings on day 1 and day 7 postTAVI) was low. Four patients followed the protocol correctly. The challenges included poor device use by only creating lead I ECGs and recalling issues. However, two cases of post-TAVI atrial fibrillation were successfully identified, demonstrating potential clinical value.
Part II – The Automatic Detection of Cardiac Conduction Times: An algorithm was developed to automatically detect the heart rate, PQ-, QRS-, and QT intervals from hospital and Kardia ECGs. The hospital ECGs were used for development as there was a lack of Kardia ECGs and their reference values. Validation was performed using 20 manually annotated Kardia ECGs and references using the MUSE NX algorithm for the hospital ECGs. Parameter optimization was performed to obtain more accurate results. The Bland-Altman plots demonstrated that the algorithm is not yet accurate enough to be used in clinical practice.
Part III – A Prediction Model for High-Grade AV Block after TAVI: Logistic regression models were trained using different (combinations of) conduction times from the preTAVI and postTAVI ECGs of TAVI patients. The most important predictors of high-grade AV block after TAVI included a wide preTAVI QRS interval and PQ interval prolongation comparing preTAVI and postTAVI. The final model achieved an AUC of 0.90, a sensitivity of 100%, and a specificity of 74% on the test set. These findings suggest that certain conduction times can serve as reliable predictors of high-grade AV block postTAVI. However, more data are needed before the implementation of this prediction model in clinical practice, due to the risk of overfitting in this dataset. General Discussion and Conclusion:
This research demonstrates the technical and clinical potential of integrating automated cardiac conduction times analysis into at-home monitoring pathways for TAVI patients. The current feasibility for patients, by technical barriers, the accuracy of the algorithm, and the lack of data limit implementation in a clinical setting. Furthermore, the predictive model for high-grade AV block could assist clinicians identify high-risk patients. With improved patient instructions, reminder systems, interface design, and improved accuracy of the algorithm (e.g., by using a machine learning model) at-home ECG monitoring may become a safe and efficient standard for TAVI protocols, potentially allowing same-day discharge in the future.",Master Technical Medicine (M-TM),"Velraeds, A.A.C.",June 2025,English,"No

Through the use of a curated blocklist, we seeked to address our research questions related to the technical aspects of the solutions implemented, their effectiveness, and their robustness against various bypassing techniques. Our results revealed two different implementation approaches: DNS-based and TLS-based filters. Moreover, we identified a notable amount of harmful websites remaining unblocked that ranges from 20,5% to
34,2%. Finally, the response of the filtering mechanisms to different bypassing techniques reflects the type of solution in place. In fact, when a DNS-based filter is in place, changing the DNS server is an effective method to bypass it.

106466,Position Domain Repetitive-Control of a Peristaltic Pump,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106466,"Peristaltic pumps are used in transporting contamination sensitive fluids with the use of flexible tubes, commonly
found on medical devices. A pulley with rollers is spun by a motor. The rollers pinch the tube and transfer a
small amount of liquid. The pump introduces disturbances due to its working principle, the rollers pushing on the
tube impact the pump velocity. Another disturbance comes from the non-perfect commutation of the brushless
DC motor used. DEMCON developed a medical device with a peristaltic pump. Currently the pump uses a PI2
controller, previously the effects of using a Inversion-Based-Disturbance-Observer-Based-Control (IBDOBC)
was investigated. The research modelled the disturbance. Building on this, the current work proposes using the
known disturbance model in combination with position-domain repetitive control to enhance performance.
The disturbance modelled shows the disturbance is periodic. Therefore a controller exploiting the periodic
nature of the disturbance is chosen as possible improvement. The disturbances have a fixed frequency in
position domain, in terms of radians, but are aperiodic in case the pump speed changes in time domain, in
terms of seconds. Position domain repetitive control is hypothesised to improve the performance of the pump.
The Position-Domain-Control (referred to as SC) is built on the traditional control method Repetitive-Control
(RC). To justify the use of SC, it is compared with RC and an intermediate controller between the two controllers,
Disturbance-Observer-Based-Repetitive-Control (DOBRC). A major advantage of the time domain controllers
is that they excel in rejecting periodic disturbances that match their design frequency and its integer multiples.
However a major shortcoming, not present in SC, is that the disturbances that do not the design frequency or
its integer multiples are amplified. Two papers are given after the literature review of DOBRC and SC that use
ideas and results generated during the thesis.
A plant model is made. Lagrangian Equations are used to formulate equations of motion, which are then
linearised to obtain a linear time invariant system representation of the plant. The plant model is later used in
the simulations and in making inverse approximations for the controllers using a disturbance observer framework
to estimate the disturbance.
Three scenarios were simulated, disturbance rejection, disturbance amplification by time domain controllers
using a steady reference and an increasing reference signal in steps. The simulation results matched with the
sensitivity plots and performance expectations.
The experiments included DOBRC, SC, linear controller and IBDOBC from previous research. RC was omitted
due to time constraints and due to DOBRC performing better in the simulations. It was not deemed useful to
experiment with when the simulations showed DOBRC, another time domain repetitive controller outperforming
it consistently. Two scenarios were experimented with, disturbance rejection and disturbance amplification by
time domain controllers. The reference signals used were all steady state references.
At the end SC and IBDOBC showed consistent performance as expected. DOBRC on the other hand had a
significant difference between the disturbance rejection and disturbance amplification scenarios. In the best case
scenario DOBRC performed best with a Root-Mean-Square error reduction of 68% form the current controller,
then SC with 40% reduction, then IBDOBC with a 26% reduction and last the linear controller. In the worst
case scenario DOBRC performed worse by 36% than the linear controller IBDOBC performed better than the
linear controller, best performer was SC.",Master Systems and Control (M-SC),"Celik, Kutay",June 2025,English,"No

The approach targets the 90th percentile of hourly nursing demand and evaluates various configurations of shift lengths, start times, and contract rules. Key findings show that combining 8- and 12-hour shifts with staggered start times can reduce staffing costs by up to 7.65% and decrease required Full Time Equivalents by 7.6%.

ratio that integrates financial performance with environmental impact. By benchmarking this ratio, the research aims to 
improve comparability across industries, enhance corporate accountability, and support informed decision-making by 
investors, regulators, and other stakeholders.
• Need for Standardization: Sustainability reporting remains fragmented due to varying frameworks such as GRI, 
SASB, and CSRD. A universal sustainability ratio would address these inconsistencies and enhance comparability.
• Sector-Specific Considerations: While a universal ratio improves transparency, industry-specific benchmarks are 
necessary to account for sectoral differences in environmental impact.
• Assurance and Verification: Many sustainability reports lack independent verification, reducing their credibility. 
Third-party assurance would enhance trust and reliability.
• Corporate Implementation Challenges: Adoption of sustainability ratios depends on their ease of calculation and 
interpretation. Providing clear guidelines and regulatory support would encourage widespread use. The study concludes that a universal sustainability ratio has the potential to improve corporate transparency and 
accountability, but its effectiveness depends on standardization, sector-specific benchmarks, and independent assurance 
mechanisms. While companies recognize the importance of sustainability metrics, regulatory enforcement and clear 
implementation strategies are essential for ensuring their meaningful adoption. Future research should focus on refining 
the ratio, expanding its application across industries, and assessing its long-term impact on corporate behavior and 
sustainability performance.",Master Industrial Engineering and Management (M-IEM),"Gerritsma, Bouke",June 2025,English,"No

However, their increasing scale poses significant challenges in fine-tuning, particularly when optimizing for long-context scenarios under constrained computational resources. While various parallelization strategies have been explored, existing approaches often rely on external libraries and are designed for large-scale multi-GPU clusters, making them impractical for resource-limited environments. This research introduces a design novelty that utilizes a 2D parallelism approach, combining Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP) and Tensor Parallelism (TP) for fine-tuning Llama 3.x models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in agentic applications where extended context length is critical. Unlike existing methods, our approach is implemented purely in PyTorch, avoiding dependencies on external parallelization frameworks like FairScale or DeepSpeed. Additionally, we focus on optimizing parallelism specifically for fine-tuning rather than pre-training, with an emphasis on prioritizing sequence length over batch size—an underexplored area in the literature. Another key innovation is the integration of the 2D parallelism paradigm into LoRA adapters' weights, which, to our knowledge, has not been systematically studied. Finally, we develop an efficient, zero-redundant model loading mechanism that is both GPU- and CPU-efficient for distributed FSDP-TP setups. By addressing these gaps, our work aims to make large-scale fine-tuning more computationally efficient and accessible in constrained environments.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Nguyen, L.G.K",June 2025,English,"No.

106460,How Endometriosis Patients in the Netherlands Cope with Pain and Fatigue : Exploring Self-Management Experiences and Needs,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106460,"Background:Endometriosis is a gynaecological condition characterised by varying pain and fatigue symptoms, which can significantly impact well-being. Treatment often overlooks contributing factors and psychological consequences. While self-management strategies may be helpful in these challenges, treatment guidelines in the Netherlands lack clear recommendations, and effective coping may require tailored support. Research on self-managing endometriosis-related pain and fatigue in the Netherlands is limited, highlighting a knowledge gap that this study aims to address.
Methods: A mixed-methods design (online survey) was employed. Recruitment occurred through the Endometriosis Foundation. A total of 195 participants (age 18-64 years) with a self-reported diagnosis or suspicion of endometriosis were included in the analysis. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. 
Results: Participants regarded endometriosis self-management as a personal journey to find effective strategies. Common strategies included physical activity, dietary changes, and balancing rest with activities. Primary support needs included accessible information on coping techniques (e.g., diet), peer support, and professional guidance (e.g., coaching), preferably via mobile apps. Needs and experiences concerning pain and fatigue were similar. Conclusion: This study advances understanding of coping with endometriosis-related pain and fatigue from the Dutch patient perspective.

tactile illusions and cross-modal perception. A prototype combining visual and
vibrotactile stimuli was developed, including a vibrotactile sleeve synchronized with
VR visuals through audio signals. User experiments were conducted to assess how
visual input affected the perception of the CRE across six different timing intervals,
with participants rating synchronization, illusion perception, and visual appeal. A
pilot test refined the prototype and testing procedure.
Results: The results suggest that the perception of the CRE can be influenced by
visual stimuli. At slower timing intervals of the CRE the addition of a visual seems
to enhance perception, at faster speeds, the visual disrupts the illusion. Participants
preferred appealing visuals, although improvements to the arm visualization were recommended
for enhanced realism.
Conclusion: This research shows that visual input could influence the timing and
perception of the CRE in VR. To improve on this research, future work should refine
visual-tactile synchronization and explore other types of tactile feedback, as well as
further analyze the relationship between timing and perception thresholds.",Bachelor Creative Technology (B-CREA),"Zwaan, Milou de",February 2025,English,"No.

The Apple Vision Pro (AVP) XR device has features specifically designed to improve social interaction in XR, such as an outward facing display that shows a representation of the user’s eyes to people in their surroundings, called “EyeSight”. This feature is hypothesised to have a positive effect on social attention between an XR user and a non-user, as research shows that eye contact and gaze information play a major role in social attention. To test this, data were collected through observations of an experimental collaborative task and a follow-up survey, comparing the social attention of XR users and non-users for AVP groups and Quest 3 groups. While differences were generally small, AVP groups demonstrated slightly more eye contact and performed slightly better, suggesting a positive influence of the “Eyesight” feature.

Predicting cost overruns is difficult because of high project uncertainty and reliance on manual, experience-based estimates. This study addresses the need for more reliable and efficient cost overrun prediction by developing a data-driven decision model using binary classification machine learning techniques. Based on a case from Bam, a major Dutch utility contractor, the study followed the CRISP data mining process, identifying 46 relevant features from 888 project records. Multiple models were compared, including random forest, decision tree, and gradient boosting. Recursive feature elimination and hyperparameter optimization were applied to refine performance. The random forest model emerged as the best, achieving an accuracy of 0.6367 and AUC of 0.7174, indicating adequate predictive power. Stakeholders found the model useful for practical cost overrun assessment. The study contributes to literature by showing that binary classification models can distinguish between projects with and without cost overruns in the utility sector.

The approach utilizes a convolutional neural network that processes stereo beamforming images to generate a volumetric representation of an acoustic field. Through synthetic data, the architecture is trained to reconstruct fields with several monopoles or line sources from the synthetic and measured input. The synthetic and experimental results show the potential for a computationally efficient complete reconstruction of an acoustic field in 3D. Arbitrary acoustic fields, composed of monopoles and line sources, can be reconstructed with low computational effort (0.482 GFLOP). A localization error of less than 50 mm can be expected. The reconstructed sound pressure level field shows acoustic patterns, noise source locations, and source intensity, which can be used for characterization, identification, or localization. As a practical demonstration, the trained model was used for a UAV tracking scenario, where it achieved high-accuracy acoustic trajectory tracking. These results suggest that deep learning-based methods offer a viable path toward real-time and high-resolution 3D acoustic field reconstruction. This will have a significant implication on the ability to reconstruct novel arbitrary acoustic fields in three dimensions lays the foundation for future research into more dynamic and complex acoustic scenes.

This research focuses on the question: “What are the key success factors that Dutch SMEs experience when selling on third-party marketplaces, and how do they relate these factors to their long-term competitive positioning?”
Based on the interviews with ten experts, this study shows that Dutch SMEs on third-party marketplaces attribute their success not to one tactic or success factor, but to a coherent set of eight success factors. The identified success factors include reputation, branding, price, content, operational processes, advertising, integrators, and data.

106435,Evaluating Paid Digital Marketing Strategies to Raise Brand Awareness in B2B Startups,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106435,"Building brand awareness efficiently is essential for B2B startups. They often operate with limited time and resources, and without a clear plan, which increases the risk of budgets being wasted on ineffective marketing activities. Digital marketing offers opportunities, particularly through paid advertising. For B2B companies, LinkedIn Ads and Google Ads are often considered the most relevant platforms.
Nevertheless, there is a lack of scientific evidence on which of these two platforms is most suitable for B2B startups. According to the AIDA model, the first step in the purchasing process is to generate attention, which was the focus of this study. As a result, startups are unsure where to allocate their limited resources best. This study, therefore, investigated the following question: Which paid digital marketing strategy – LinkedIn Ads or Google Ads – is most suitable for B2B startups to increase brand awareness?
To answer this research question, an A/B test was conducted to compare the effectiveness of LinkedIn Ads and Google Ads in increasing brand awareness for a B2B startup. One advertisement was placed on both platforms, promoting the same service to a comparable target audience. The experiment was carried out for a company that provides services to schools.
The results indicate that Google Ads outperformed LinkedIn Ads in both reach and cost-efficiency. While LinkedIn Ads generated only 16 clicks at an average cost per click (CPC) of €8.75 and a click-through rate (CTR) of 0.38%, Google Ads achieved 1,419 clicks with a significantly lower CPC of €0.10 and a CTR of 1.5%. This means a click via LinkedIn was approximately 8,650% more expensive.
These results align with previous studies that emphasize the effectiveness of Google Ads in generating traffic. Although LinkedIn is generally regarded as an effective B2B marketing platform, this study suggests it is less efficient in generating attention.
For B2B startups with limited budgets, it is therefore recommended to invest primarily in Google Ads during the awareness phase. This channel provides greater visibility and engagement at lower costs. LinkedIn may be considered in later stages of the marketing funnel, such as lead generation and conversion, but appears to be less suitable for initiating brand awareness.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Petter, M.M.",June 2025,English,"No

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer significant potential for acceleration due to their inherent parallelism. This thesis presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the Mondrian Forest online learning algorithm on an FPGA platform. Mondrian Forests, while effective for online tasks, pose challenges for hardware implementation due to dynamic tree structures and large node sizes. To address this, we developed an FPGA architecture targeting the AMD Versal xcvh1742 card, leveraging its High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and parallel processing capabilities. The architecture employs multiple processing units, a page-based memory system to manage tree nodes efficiently, and specific adaptations to the algorithm, such as top-down posterior updates, for hardware suitability. Performance was evaluated using simulation and analytical methods on synthetic and KDD datasets. Results demonstrate substantial speedups compared to an optimized CPU (Rust-based Light-river) implementation, achieving 42.33x faster execution on the synthetic dataset and 56.42x on the KDD dataset, while maintaining high classification accuracy. While the implementation was slower (4.90x) than a specialized Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) FPGA implementation on the KDD dataset, it showed slightly better accuracy.

Through thematic analysis of these critical incidents, thirteen Irish cultural standards were identified, which were then grouped into four underlying values: Cúram (care/caution), Craic (friendliness/humor), Solúbthacht (flexibility/adaptability), and Údarás (authority). These values provide a culturally grounded explanation for Irish workplace behaviours as perceived by Dutch expatriates. Findings from this study contribute to the field of European intercultural management and offer practical insights for professionals operating in Dutch–Irish contexts. By understanding the underlying logic of Irish cultural norms, Dutch professionals can improve their cultural awareness, adapt their expectations, and enhance cross-cultural collaboration in the workplace.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Hoekstra, T.A.",May 2025,English,"No

However, traditional methods require costly devices, complicated wearable markers, and controlled environments, which limit their accessibility in reality. This study proposes a lightweight real-time motion tracking system using a head-mounted display (HMD) with visual overlay in the physical environment. Only with a simple calibration, the full-body motion capturing and point cloud visualization could be achieved, with a built-in joint angle calculation for analyzing the subject's kinematics. The system was evaluated for stability and latency, while the tracking kinematics was evaluated for accuracy, continuity and consistency. The experimental results showed the reliability of both the system design and the tracking results. Overall, the proposed system offers a portable, convenient, and efficient motion tracking solution.

Historically it has been approached by generating rule-based policies to determine how much of each item should be included after an order is triggered, but recent effort has been placed in using advances in machine learning within the field. This work contributes to the existing body of knowledge by developing a generalised neural network joint replenishment policy by incorporating demand stochasticity and non-zero lead time durations in ordering at most one unit of transport per period. Applying deep controlled learning to a specialised setting pertaining to dominant transport costs, the proposed solution vastly outperforms existing approaches to learn a policy which effectively exploits cost parameters and maintains a high fill rate for a small item setting. Expanding to a larger problem instance, its computational efficiency is evidenced to impair its ability to perform well.

This enables the use of online adaptive radiotherapy, enabling online adaptation of treatment plans. However, a bottleneck in the clinical workflow is the time-intensive contouring process required for each radiotherapy fraction. In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence techniques holds great promise for automated segmentation in radiation oncology. However, it remains challenging to distinguish between accurate and poor-quality segmentations for individual patients. To address this, Monte Carlo dropout was introduced as a method for estimating model uncertainty, providing insight into a model’s confidence in its predictions. This thesis investigated to what extent uncertainty can support quality assurance for prostate autosegmentation in the MR-Linac workflow. We trained a DeepLabV3+ model for MR-based prostate segmentation and applied Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that uncertainty, when properly calibrated, serves as a valuable tool for assessing model confidence, offering insights into the reliability of predictions and their geometric accuracy. Consequently, uncertainty can be a helpful tool in the approval process of autosegmentations. Furthermore, we show that targeting and correcting voxels with the highest uncertainty leads to the most significant improvements in both geometric and dosimetric outcomes. Therefore, uncertainty-guided correction offers a promising tool for editing autosegmentations. These findings emphasize the potential of uncertainty-based quality assurance for prostate autosegmentation in the MR-Linac workflow.",Master Technical Medicine (M-TM),"Eek, D.M.C.",June 2025,English,"No.

During the experiment, the participants filled out ratings of perceived intensity and liking. While the color modality presentations did not significantly affect the perceived intensity, they significantly influenced the liking scores, with Food Color having a lower satisfaction than the other three color presentations. Yellow was linked to a lower perceived intensity compared to other colors, while it was linked to higher liking scores across the conditions together with the Red color. There was a significant interaction between the color modality presentations and colors in intensity ratings.

It reduces seizure frequency by more than 50% in 50-60% of the patients. However, it remains unclear which epilepsy patients will benefit from VNS, leading to ineffective treatment. We assessed whether the stability of the morphological features in interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) could serve as a predictive biomarker for this process. Ultra-long subcutaneous EEG data prior to VNS implantation were analyzed. Several morphological features and similarity metrics were assessed for correlation with visual IED stability assessment. Subsequently, we evaluated the correlation between these features and the VNS effect. Only the variability in the spike and slow wave durations showed the expected negative correlation with the visual IED assessment (r = −0.91, p = 0.030 and r = −0.83, p = 0.081, respectively). These features showed a strong negative correlation with the improvement in QoL (r = −0.98, p = 0.004 and r = −0.98, p = 0.003, respectively) and showed lower IQR values within the responders group.

cyclists’ situational awareness, heightening the risk of accidents. This paper proposes the utilization of an open-source OpenEarable device, which is equipped with onboard inertial measurement units (IMU), as an easy and non-invasive method for detecting visual distractions through the quantification of head movements that are indicative of behaviours associated with visual distraction. Head movement patterns of 20 subjects were recorded using earable IMU sensors in naturalistic cycling scenarios. Classical machine learning and deep learning models were employed to analyze the collected data and identify patterns characteristic of visual distractions in cyclists. Among machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the highest F1-score (85%) with a fair Kappa score (0.59). In deep
learning models, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) offers
the best F1-score (87%) and a substantial Kappa score (0.74). To asses edge-deployment feasibility, the models are further optimized and evaluated for deployment on Raspberry Pi. The LinearSVC variant of the SVM model offers the best tradeoff between model size, inference time, and classification performance. Whereas, for CNN, quantization techniques like Post Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) reduce the model size without sacrificing performance.

As algorithms and their use both in the public and private sectors are increasing, it becomes unavoidable for the EU to face the question of how the use of algorithms can be reconciled with EU values. This research analyses the EU's perspective on algorithmic governance in its Digital Decade 2030 policy programme. Through a qualitative content analysis, the theoretical key expectation that algorithmic governance has an exercise of power at heart that can violate the rule of law is examined. While the EU addresses algorithmic governance in the Digital Decade programme, it plays a marginal role throughout the documents. The core theme in which algorithms are portrayed in the Digital Decade programme is a conflict between the potential positive effects on people's lives in the EU that can be brought about through algorithmic governance, and the algorithmic harms that would destroy such a positive vision. The commitment to the rule of law is emphasised, while no clear strategy is laid out for how it will be further strengthened. This research argues that the EU fails to establish a policy programme that ensures that the rule of law will be followed and safeguarded in algorithmic governance.

106407,Evolving State Self-Confidence : A Weekly Experience Sampling Study of First- and Continuous Generation Students’ Experiences During Their Internship,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106407,"A pivotal phase in a student’s educational journey is the start of their internship. Navigating life transitions like internships requires self-confidence, defined as an individual’s belief in one’s capacity to meet challenges or accomplish goals (Fillery-travis et al., 2006). This transition from academic learning to practical application is frequently experienced differently by First-Generation Students (FGS) and Continuous Generation Students (CGS). FGS are the first in their family to attend tertiary education, whereas CGS have at least one parent with a tertiary degree (Billett, 2014). While studies frequently make general comparisons between FGS and CGS, they rarely delve into the dynamic and situation-specific growth of state self-confidence during internships. This study addresses this gap by exploring how internship experiences shape students’ state self-confidence over time using an Experience Sampling Method (ESM). A baseline questionnaire and weekly questionnaires were used to collect data from 86 psychology students during their internship. No significant effects of internship experiences on state self-confidence a week later were found, but significant effects were found for such relationships within the same week. It was expected that generational status would impact the cross-lagged relationships between internship experiences and state self-confidence levels. This was not confirmed with the cross-lagged data analysis. Overall, it was expected that state self-confidence would stabilise over the duration of the internship. The quadratic model revealed great variations per week, but no significant stabilisation of state self-confidence from the start of the internship to the end of the internship.

Using a combination of satellite images and altimetry products, this study monitors at how the water level and extent changes during the different operational filling phases of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance (GER) Dam. The primary aim was to utilize different remote sensing products to provide an accurate estimation of water volume changes over time. Sentinel-1 data were processed using an unsupervised edge Otsu algorithm to map reservoir extents. The output maps were validated against Planet and Sentinel-2 water masks, which showed good agreement with overall accuracy values raging from 0.97 to 0.99. Additionally, various SWOT satellite products were utilized to estimate reservoir extents, with the SWOT Lake Single Product performing poor with an IOU value close to 0.33, while the SWOT water mask raster and pixel cloud products showed moderate agreement with the validation sets with overall accuracy values ranging from 0.78 to 0.89. Volume variation across different dam operational phases was estimated using satellite-based observations and a DEM contouring method. Although both methods exhibited a high correlation (R2 value of 0.98), significant differences in values were identified (RMSE value of 2736.35), likely due to an unnoticed scaling error and the inherent water slope in the GER Dam reservoir. A DEM slope correction method was applied, but the two-point correction approach was insufficient to accurately represent the complex terrain, leading to overestimations of volume variation. The SWOT satellite products were also utilized to estimate volume variation over time. However, due to the absence of temporally collocated in-situ data for validation, it was not possible to validate SWOT based volume estimations.

Using VR technology, a virtual rowing simulation was made in which participants carry out two tasks, a reference task, and a stress-inducing checkpoint task designed to induce stress. The fNIRS technology was then used to analyse the brain activity, particularly the following four regions: right prefrontal cortex, left prefrontal cortex, motor cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex. 
In total, 18 participants with varying rowing experience completed the two tasks while their rowing performance and brain activity was being recorded.

106401,Updating the Role of ICT for Social Connectedness Among the Elderly During and Post Pandemic : A Scoping Review,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106401,"Background: Social connectedness is essential for well-being, particularly among older
adults at risk of loneliness and isolation due to life transitions and the COVID-19 pandemic. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has emerged as a tool to mitigate these challenges by facilitating relationships and fostering community.
Aim: This scoping review examines ICT’s role in enhancing social connectedness among older adults during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying research gaps for future studies.
Method: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search of Scopus, PsycInfo, and Web of Science (202032024) identified empirical studies on ICT-based social engagement for adults aged ≥60. Eligible qualitative studies explored tools such as video conferencing, social media, and virtual reality. Editorials, reviews, meta-analyses, commentaries, and studies on non-communication technologies were excluded. Data were analyzed using descriptive and thematic analysis.
Results: A total of 29 studies showed ICT significantly reduced loneliness and improved social connectedness. However, barriers such as digital literacy, access inequalities, and privacy concerns persist. While video conferencing, social media, and virtual reality show promise, their potential remains underexplored.
Conclusion: ICT is a valuable tool for promoting social connectedness among older adults, particularly in crises. Addressing persistent barriers through user-centered designs and targeted interventions is crucial. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies and emerging technologies to enhance ICT’s impact.

106400,Gambling Advertising in Transition : How Dutch Regulatory Changes Reshaped Gambling Marketing Strategies,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106400,"This study examined how gambling advertisers in the Netherlands have adapted exploitation of heuristics in response to regulatory changes since the implementation of the Remote Gambling Act on October 1, 2021. By analysing how persuasive mechanisms evolved following regulations, this research assessed whether restrictions affected the exploited heuristics in gambling advertisements.
A content analysis was conducted on 696 gambling advertisements spanning five regulatory periods, focussing on the use of heuristics. The study categorised and tracked the prevalence of key heuristics, such as anchoring, mental accounting, and social proof, to determine shifts in advertising strategies.
Following new restrictions, a shift occurred from traditional media to data-driven online platforms, where advertisers utilised heuristics better suited for personalised online targeting, while adopting more cost-efficient strategies to maintain visibility despite reduced budgets. Findings indicated that dominant heuristics were primarily used to attract new players and re-engage past users, despite the legalisation’s stated goal of shifting existing gamblers to regulated platforms.Rather than reducing the persuasive power of gambling advertisements, regulations influenced their distribution channels. The persistent use of heuristics that encourage impulsive engagement suggests that current policies may be insufficient in reducing harm. Stronger interventions, such as restricting misleading heuristic-based tactics, may be necessary to enhance consumer protection.",Master Communication Science (M-COM),"Montfoort, D.P.M. van",January 2025,English,"No

Navigation accuracy through the colon can be reduced because of these limitations, which increase the risk of tissue damage to the intestinal walls. This study validates the use of a soft robotic origami-based endoscope with head-mounted control and haptic feedback to address these challenges. The pressure-angle relationship of the origami-based actuator was characterized, a PI controller was implemented for closed-loop accuracy, and ramp and step input references were tested. In user trials, participants were asked to follow a predetermined 2D path trajectory representing the colon. The user accuracy and experience of various haptic feedback methods were analysed. While for one chamber bending, the PI controller showed improving performance, oscillations at higher bending angles showed limitations to the tuning of the controller. Between the various haptic feedback methods, no statistically significant differences were observed, though an experiential preference was found for two motor vibrations in questionnaires.

Timely and effective fluid resuscitation or vasopressor therapy is critical, though their indiscriminate use carries risks. This thesis proposes a patient-specific, physiology-informed approach to managing hemodynamic instability, focusing on clinical decision-making, arterial pressure waveform (APW) analysis, and computational modeling. Research was conducted within the framework of the PACIFIC study, a prospective, observational cohort study in a tertiary ICU. The first study examined physicians’ rationale and goals in initiating or escalating therapy, revealing inconsistency and that only 45% of treatment goals within 15 minutes were met. This highlights the need for structured, physiology-based guidance. The second study analyzed APW morphology before and after therapy. Variations, especially in dicrotic notch morphology, suggest that APW features could guide individualized hemodynamic management. The third study used a patient-specific Windkessel model to estimate peripheral resistance and blood volume from APW data. While group trends aligned with expected effects, individual variability exposed modeling limitations, yet supported the model's potential for patient-specific insight in hemodynamic instability.

106386,Towards integral capacity managed disability care : Integral capacity management in the behavioural scientific outpatient clinics of ‘s Heeren Loo,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106386,"Background:
's Heeren Loo is a disability care organisation. They offer behavioural scientific care in their thirty-three outpatient clinics. This research focuses on their behavioural scientific outpatient clinics. With their current management strategy, they are not able to offer acceptable access times for their clients, nor maintain a financially healthy organisation. Therefore, ‘s Heeren Loo must rethink the organisation and business administration of their outpatient clinics. To this end, they started a program to promote their outpatient clinics. It contributes to the three promises of ‘s Heeren Loo: a good life for clients, attractive work for staff, and a healthy and sustainable organisation. Deploying integral capacity management is a component of this program.
Objective:
The aim of this study is to contribute to the sustainable organisation of outpatient behavioural scientific care within 's Heeren Loo by designing a proposal for the implementation of integral capacity management. 
Methods: 
We answer eight research questions in this report. We follow the methodology of the managerial problem-solving approach, because the phases of this approach correspond with the questions posed. Methods we use in this study encompass exploratory field research, literature review, data analysis and stakeholder consultation.
Results
The main finding of this study is that the behavioural scientific outpatient clinics of 's Heeren Loo currently fail to collect sufficient reliable data. Analysis of the available data reveals shows variability in treatment across several outpatient clinics that exceed norms that have been established by ‘s Heeren Loo. Due to the lack of reliable data, we are currently unable to reduce the variability, which is the first step of integral capacity management. Our research shows that management of the behavioural scientific outpatient clinics currently do employ integral capacity management activities. However, mainly tactical medical and resource capacity activities are currently lacking. Moreover, decisions are currently not taken in an integral manner, but within their own managerial domain. Integral capacity management relies on a solid performance management system. This is necessary to make and evaluate data-driven decisions. Currently, the outpatient clinics collect mainly financial data. Based on literature, we propose an expansion of their performance management system
Conclusions:
Our first conclusion is that ‘s Heeren Loo currently fails to collect sufficient reliable data. 
Our second conclusion is that the outpatient clinics employ few tactical medical and resource capacity activities, and decisions are not made in an integral way but rather within their own managerial department. 
Our third conclusion is that the current performance management system at the outpatient clinics of ‘s Heeren Loo gathers mainly financial information. With this limited information, management of the outpatient clinics is not able to evaluate organisational performance based on their three core promises.
Our fourth conclusion is that variability in care delivery at the behavioural outpatient clinics exists, and exceeds standards that have been established by ‘s Heeren Loo.",Master Health Sciences (M-HS),"Woudenberg, J.E.",May 2025,English,"No.

A custom algorithm combined objective and subjective data to generate personalized sleep recommendations. Despite some limitations, 31% of sleep durations were not returned, and only 40% matched self-reported durations within ±45 minutes, 3 out of 11 participants showed improvements across all measured domains. These included more consistent sleep duration, better perceived sleep quality, fewer nightly toilet visits, and quicker sleep onset. Five additional participants improved in most areas. Most participants preferred behavior-based recommendations over fixed goals and appreciated visual feedback. Technical issues with the OnePlanet Research app led to two dropouts and some user frustration.

the vast majority of cancer deaths. The metastatic success of CTCs hinges foremost on their capacity to
survive the environmental conditions within the bloodstream, which is generally poor for primary
tumour cells. This study includes a literature review concerning the various survival mechanisms
presented by CTCs that enhance their metastatic capacity, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), recruitment of platelets or other cell types and incorporation of cells into cellular aggregates,
referred to as CTC clusters. Experimental studies are included, inspired by the literature review,
concerning the formation and characterization of homotypic and heterotypic CTC clusters produced
artificially by (co-)culturing the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and the HMF mammary fibroblast
cell lines in agarose microwell arrays. The size of the CTC cluster was similar among the combinations of
incorporated cell lines and could be controlled by adjusting the initial seeding density. Strikingly, MDAMB-
231 cells could not be incorporated into homotypic clusters or heterotypic clusters in combination
with MCF-7 cells, but were incorporated into heterotypic clusters with HMF cells. Moreover, the
respective distribution of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in heterotypic HMF/breast cancer clusters
indicates that MDA-MB-231 and HMF cells express intercellular adhesion proteins that interact more
favourably with each other than themselves, whereas the opposite was observed for the combination of
MCF-7 and HMF cells. Together, this study presents the production of homotypic and heterotypic breast
cancer tumour cell clusters from cell lines as an easily producible bottom-up model for CTC clusters.

It is intended as a more accessible and physically grounded alternative to head-mounted display (HMD) Virtual Reality (VR), which, despite its widespread use, can lead to reduced embodiment, increased cognitive load, and other limitations. The proposed system, called MIRA (Mirror for Interactive Reality Augmentations), was designed to reproduce physically accurate reflections while enabling real-time visual augmentations. A user study (n=35) explored the technical and perceptual feasibility of the system and its capacity to trigger self-referential behaviour. Results showed that 63% of participants exhibited behavioural reactions to a virtual stain placed on their clothing in the mirror image, suggesting effective attention capture and self-association. However, the system suffered from high latency (~500ms), which disrupted the natural feel of the mirror and limited participants’ belief in the augmentations. Over half of the participants misinterpreted the mirror’s behaviour, possibly due to this limitation, or a fundamental misunderstanding of mirror workings.

Considering client feedback was shown to improve the therapeutic alliance and clinical outcomes, therefore an increasing amount of research evaluating psychotherapy focuses on the client’s perspective. This study aimed to gain deeper insight into clients’ experiences of group-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) at the mental health organisation “Mindfit”. Specifically, it investigated which therapeutic aspects were most valuable for participants. A total of 68 evaluative questionnaires, completed anonymously by participants, were analysed. They included one scaling and five open-ended questions. A hybrid thematic analysis (HTA) was conducted, in which the six core processes of ACT and the Pause-Choice Model were utilised as deductive codes. Inductive codes emerged from the data. The analysis resulted in five themes deemed particularly valuable by clients, ordered from highest to lowest frequency in the data: Supportive Group Environment (176), Learning How to Recognise and Manage Internal Experiences (81), Modes of Education (46), Practical Application of ACT Techniques (42) and Learning How to Lead a Meaningful Life (37). Shortcomings of the treatment are included in the theme Limitations and Challenges in ACT group therapy (18). The group setting, the core processes acceptance and cognitive defusion and the practical application of ACT, including the Pause-Choice Model, were perceived to have the highest value for participants. Use of ACT terminology by clients in the questionnaires suggests successful learning, while the group setting enhanced sharing of personal experiences and common humanity.

106373,Monitoring in Dutch youth care: A qualitative study on improvement steps for performance monitoring of youth care providers,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106373,"Since 2015, Dutch municipalities have been responsible for procuring and monitoring youth care. However, due to a lack of guidelines, knowledge, and capacity, the monitoring process varies between regions, resulting in limited insight into provider performance. This research investigates the necessary steps to establish an effective performance monitoring process within Dutch youth care. A qualitative case study was conducted. Through literature review, current monitoring methods, contract types, and bottlenecks were identified. Based on this, thirteen semi-structured interviews were held with professionals (contract managers, policy advisors, and quality managers) from ten procurement regions. These interviews focused on existing practices, challenges, and improvement needs. The findings reveal that regions use tools such as client satisfaction surveys, quarterly reports, performance meetings, and reactive supervision. However, these methods often fail to provide a clear picture of care quality. Key issues include administrative burden, limited data literacy, and the absence of a standardized process, making regional comparisons difficult. The study concludes that effective monitoring requires a more uniform and structured approach. Recommendations include investing in knowledge and capacity, developing a standard monitoring system, incorporating client feedback, using a PDCA cycle, and enhancing interregional cooperation with both quantitative and qualitative data.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Schilderink, J.L.M.",May 2025,English,"No.

106372,Key Performance Indicators in Dutch Youth Care : A qualitative study on improving quality monitoring across procurement regions,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106372,"Since the decentralization of youth care in the Netherlands in 2015, municipalities have been responsible for its procurement and quality. This shift has led to challenges such as rising demand, long waiting times, and limited insight into care effectiveness. Quality assessments often rely on trust in providers, with little structural monitoring. This study explores which Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) could help improve the quality of Dutch youth care. A literature review and ten semi-structured interviews with professionals from seven regional procurement organizations were conducted. The results show significant variation in KPI use across regions. In five regions, KPIs are rarely used. Existing indicators mainly focus on structural or process aspects, such as staffing and capacity. However, there is a clear need for KPIs that assess treatment outcomes and care processes, such as recidivism rates and care continuity. Implementing effective KPIs faces challenges, including lack of standardization, fragmented data collection, and insufficient collaboration. The study concludes that there is a strong need for process-oriented KPIs developed in cooperation with care providers. These indicators should support joint quality improvement rather than control. Investment in data skills and staffing is necessary. Future research should focus on developing practical, broadly supported KPIs in collaboration with clients and providers.",Master Health Sciences (M-HS),"Schilderink, J.L.M.",May 2025,English,"No

Globalization has been a phenomenon for decades, and exposure to other cultures happens on a daily
basis. One benefits from having sufficient knowledge about the dominant culture of their living and
working area. Therefore, this study explores the cultural differences between Italy and the Netherlands
from the perspective of Dutch expatriates living and working in Italy, providing qualitative emic insights
into Italian behavior that Dutch people may encounter when working in Italy Sixteen Dutch expatriates, living and working in Italy for at least six months, were interviewed using
semi-structured interviews. The Dutch interviewees were asked to provide experiences of their work
life in Italy. There was a focus on critical incidents, situations where the cultures of Italians and the
Dutch clashed. Using these critical incidents, typical Italian behaviors were identified, which are
represented in cultural standards. In total, 14 cultural standards were identified, with an extra 2
behaviors that did not completely fit the term ‘cultural standard’. These identified cultural standards
were then clustered into groups where there was an overarching underlying Italian cultural value. The
identified Italian behavior, also known as Italian cultural standards, could all be explained by the Italian
cultural values of Hierarchy, Social relationships, Flexibility, and Bella figura. Comparing the findings
of this study to the existing literature on differences between Italian and Dutch culture resulted in a
better understanding between the two cultures on the work floor. Finally, a practical guide was created

106366,Comparing Business Process Modelling and S-PDFA for modeling attacker strategies,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106366,"Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts constantly have to deal with attacks on their systems. Attack paths visualize how attackers move through a network and are used by analysts to gain more insight into attacker strategies. In current research approaches, attack graphs are created based on known vulnerabilities and topology settings, making the process of creating attack graphs time-consuming as this information needs to be gathered beforehand. Creating attack graphs based on alert data by hand would cost even more time, especially with the increasingly large amount of alert data that analysts have to sort through. To alleviate these issues, SAGE was created. SAGE is a program that can automatically generate attack graphs based on alert data alone, without the need for a priori knowledge. This means that no knowledge about configurations is needed to run SAGE and instead only alert data is needed. Currently, SAGE uses a Suffix-based Probabilistic Deterministic Finite Automaton (S-PDFA) model, which can semantically distinguish identical attack steps in different stages of an attack. However, the attack graphs generated can only show the adversary's steps sequentially. This limits how closely we can represent the actual attacker strategies. For example, when an attacker performs steps simultaneously (meaning that the order in which these steps happen does not matter), this parallel behaviour should be reflected in the final attack graphs. Business Process Modelling (BPM) is a popular way to transform business processes into models, which \textit{can} model this concurrent behaviour. In this research, we are the first to apply BPM to improve SAGE's automatic attack graph generation. We do this by comparing the S-PDFA, BPM, and S-PDFA + BPM model combinations to see which results in the best attack graphs. This comparison is done based on a balance between how well the model represents the input data and the readability of the final attack graphs. This balance is quantified using the replay fitness and simplicity metrics, respectively. In this research, we found that a combination of S-PDFA and BPM performed best. However, more research needs to be done on the automatic modification of the resulting attack graphs to ensure the best simplicity score.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Bojorge-Alvarez, J.",May 2025,English,"No

Furthermore, the wake structure of VAWT allows placing wind turbines closer together, achieving higher wind farm energy extraction density.
Most challenges of VAWT originate from the large fluctuation in local flow conditions within each rotational cycle, creating a highly complex dynamic flow regime and large cyclic loading. 
This research developed a modular research platform scaled wind turbine, to allow wind tunnel investigations on influence of any geometrical parameter on turbine performance.
To mitigate problems caused by varying flow conditions, an electronic, programmable individual pitch mechanism was implemented, providing complete control over the blade pitch at any point in the cycle.
An analytical model was developed to generate efficient pitching trajectories, which were tested in the wind tunnel for various turbine configurations (number of blades, chord lengths, spans), demonstrating significant performance improvements over conventional VAWT.
Future experimental work may include mapping the VAWT parameter space, optimizing pitch for load reduction, cross-validating simulations and studying the wake of pitch-actuated VAWTs.",Master Mechanical Engineering (M-ME),"Vernhout, Daniël",June 2025,English,"No

However, currently, the hosting capacity of the grid is reached in large parts of the Netherlands. This hampers the growth and sustainability of the Dutch economy. Traditional grid reinforcement is constrained by workforce shortages, prompting Distribution System Operators (DSOs), like Liander, to explore alternative solutions like Dynamic Thermal Rating (DTR). DTR enables more efficient use of existing assets by adapting capacity limits based on real-time or forecasted conditions. Yet, aligning the various DTR initiatives is complex. This research investigates how an asset taxonomy, used to classify electrical grid components and associated initiatives, can serve as an architectural view to support strategic decision-making and enhance the capacity of the electrical grid using existing assets. Through the application of the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) an asset taxonomy of the electrical grid, as operated by Liander, is developed. Existing DTR initiatives and relevant policy documents are mapped to this taxonomy. A workshop including a fictional case study within Liander’s Asset en Product Management (APM) department was conducted. This allowed for testing the taxonomy’s ability to support strategic decision-making. Responses to a survey conducted at the end of the workshop indicate that the taxonomy is perceived as clearly structured and useful for identifying gaps and avoiding redundancies between initiatives. However, its effectiveness in supporting impact assessment, collaboration and prioritization across the initiatives appears limited.

transforming metallic copper aluminum films into p-type transparent semiconductor films
through controlled annealing in oxygen and sulfur atmospheres, respectively. The structural,
optical, electrical, and morphological properties of the films were investigated, focusing on the
effects of annealing temperature, time, and film thickness.
The method consisted of depositing CuAl films with a CuAl ratio of 1.4:1 on a glass substrate
using DC sputtering with varying film thicknesses (5 nm, 30 nm, and 100 nm). The films were
then subjected to thermal treatment in a tube oven. The results show that annealing the films in
an oxygen atmosphere resulted in the formation of CuAl/CuAlOx dual-phase films due to surface
oxidation, while annealing in a sulfur atmosphere led to CuAl/CuAlSx mixed-phase films due to
surface sulphurization. The electrical properties and transmittance of the 5 nm films changed
significantly after annealing compared to the 30-nm and 100-nm thick films.
The most promising films were the 5 nm film annealed in an oxygen atmosphere at 400°C for 12
hours and the 5 nm film annealed in a sulfur atmosphere at 500°C for 5 hours. These films
exhibited improved electrical properties, such as decreased resistivity and increased mobility, as
well as increased transmittance and band gap values compared to the as deposited films.
Although the annealed films exhibited n-type conductivity, achieving ultra-thin films with these
properties holds significant importance as novel transparent electrodes for semiconductor devices

The aim of this thesis is to study the customer-supplier interface in different types of servitization in industrial business context and to build a maturity model to guide the practitioners. Following the design science research methodology and by conducting a systematic literature review, five important dimensions of customer-supplier interface and servitization were found relevant for the following three types of servitization; basic product-oriented, R&D-oriented, and functional and operational servitization. To evaluate the customer-supplier interface dimensions against these three servitization types, initially a framework was built and later it was demonstrated in three different maturity models. The results provide a valuable contribution to theory and practice, yet, future research is needed to validate the proposed maturity models.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Yogarasa, Yasotha",May 2025,English,"No.

106342,Managing the Unseen : A Qualitative Study on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome-Related Pain and Symptom Management,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106342,"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a chronic endocrine disorder that affects multiple aspects of life for women of reproductive age. Along with symptoms like irregular periods, hormonal imbalances, and the presence of ovarian cysts, some women also face chronic pain. Although PCOS is recognised as a complex condition with diverse symptoms, the specific role of pain and its influence on quality of life remains underexplored in the existing literature.
Objectives: This study aimed to explore how PCOS patients experience their symptoms, including pain, the strategies they use to manage their symptoms, and how effective they perceive those strategies to be.
Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with 16 individuals diagnosed with PCOS. Thematic analysis was used to identify key patterns in symptom experiences and management strategies.
Results: Pain was not initially mentioned as a primary symptom, but it emerged when prompted. For patients, pain was present but was often overlooked or minimised. They tend to report other symptoms they considered more visible or disruptive, such as acne, excessive hair growth, weight gain, and menstrual irregularities. Psychological factors, such as stress, played a significant role in the experience of pain. Many participants expressed dissatisfaction with pharmaceutical approaches for managing their symptoms and instead preferred self-monitoring, natural approaches, and support from other women with PCOS.
Conclusions: Pain in PCOS is often overlooked, both by patients themselves and healthcare professionals. Psychological stress can exacerbate both symptoms and pain in individuals with PCOS. Self-management of other symptoms efforts often overlapped with pain management, with a preference for patient-directed strategies and psychological techniques for managing pain.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Haddadi, Romina",May 2025,English,"No.

The primary objective of this evaluation method is to pinpoint the most suitable routes and hubs for launching the electrification initiative. Additionally, a second method addresses the simultaneous demand for charging stations from multiple trucks, conceptualized as a Capacitated Homogeneous Electric Vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows. In this framework, the input consists of a fixed route sequence that cannot be modified for loading and unloading activities, although an additional stop for recharging can be integrated into the sequence. The aim is to improve the feasibility of driving routes with electric trucks by exploring three strategies: waiting at a location for a charging station to become available, detouring to a nearby hub with an accessible charging station, or continuing to the next destination if the truck can reach it while meeting the required SoC threshold.

This study addressed that gap by exploring how voters reflect on and experience their own decision-making, focusing on the interplay between rational reasoning and more emotional, less-rational considerations. A qualitative narrative approach was used, based on 40 semi-structured interviews with Dutch voters. Each interview began with an open-ended narrative prompt inviting participants to share their voting experiences across the last two national elections, followed by 11 questions informed by existing literature and the study’s conceptual framework to probe both rational and less-rational influences. Findings revealed that voters often blended analytical reasoning with intuitive or emotional influences. Rational factors such as issue alignment and voting guides were common, yet gut feelings and group identity also played a role. Many participants combined both types of influence in the same narrative.

Servitization, a firm’s transition from a traditional product-centric business model towards a service-centric
approach, has been accelerated by AI, positioning the technology as a key strategy for increased revenue growth,
enhanced customer satisfaction, and cost reduction. While the benefits and challenges of AI in servitization are
widely recognized, and the number of papers in this area has risen significantly, literature has primarily addressed
the benefits of AI in servitization, rather than the factors that accommodate and hinder AI’s employment in
servitization. This study therefore explores these drivers and barriers of AI in servitizing, focusing specifically on

While most individuals adapt to their 
loss over time, some people experience intense and persistent grief that impairs daily functioning, known as 
Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD). Identifying grievers at risk of PGD may allow for targeted prevention 
measures. The current study investigated the association between demographic and loss-related variables on 
PGD intensity in a large data sample.
Methods: Cross-sectional data from 13,779 participants were analysed. All participants completed the 
Traumatic Grief Inventory, Self Report Plus (TGI-SR+), a validated measure for assessing grief symptoms, also 
providing demographic and loss-related information. PGD intensity was calculated using 10 items from the 
TGI-SR+. Descriptive statistics and normality tests were conducted, followed by correlation analyses, Pearson's 
correlation, independent t-tests, and one-way ANOVA. A multiple regression analysis was performed to examine 
the combined effect of these factors on PGD intensity.
Results: After applying the exclusion criteria, the final sample consisted of 4,566 participants (81% women, M
= 52.26 years, SD = 15.49), with a mean PGD intensity score of 33.55 (SD = 7.25). PGD intensity was 
significantly higher among participants who lost a loved one due to murder or manslaughter than those in all 
other groups (p < .001). Participants in the “other” cause of death group reported significantly higher PGD 
intensity than those who lost someone to physical illness (p = .019). Participants who lost a child reported 
significantly higher PGD intensity than all other groups (p < .001). Participants who lost a partner reported 
significantly higher PGD intensity than those who lost a parent (p < .001). Time since loss showed a weak but 
significant negative correlation with PGD intensity (r = −0.071, p < .001). Gender and age were not 
significantly associated with PGD intensity. The regression models explained 2.9% of the variance in PGD 
intensity.
Conclusion: This study found that PGD intensity was highest among participants who had lost a child, partner, 
or loved one to murder/manslaughter or other causes. PGD intensity slightly declined with time since loss and 
age, while gender showed no significant association. Although the findings were statistically significant, they

106327,Enhancing robot legibility in hospital environments through shape-changing,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106327,"As robots increasingly navigate social environments like hospital hallways, effective communication of their intentions is of importance.
This paper investigates shape-changing, the ability of an entity to intentionally manipulate its torso to undergo deformations with the aim of conveying messages, intentions, or information, as a novel communication modality to improve robot legibility for hospital navigation. While existing non-verbal modalities, such as lights and gestures, are already used to enhance robot legibility, they can fall short in meeting the complex demands of hospital environments. To address the limitations, this study explores shape-changing as a novel modality. Inspired by natural behaviors and animation principles, shape-changing offers visually clear and intuitive cues that may better align with the crowded and diverse nature of hospital environments. We conducted a 2x2 within-subjects experiment in a virtual reality hospital environment, comparing shape-changing with blinkers. Participants interacted with a robot using gaze, shape-changing, blinkers, or a combination of these modalities. We measured response time, accuracy, confidence, and surprise ratings, which are supported by qualitative findings. Additionally, we used the Robotic Social Attributes Scale (ROSAS) to examine how shape-changing influences the perceived social attributes of the robot. Results suggest that shape-changing is a promising modality for improving legibility, but its effectiveness depends on design and integration with other modalities. While shape-changing was perceived as intuitive, it could also be intimidating or shocking. Combining shape-changing with blinkers improved user confidence and reduced surprise, though inconsistencies between modalities sometimes caused mixed signals. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that shape-changing shows promise as a novel modality for improving robot legibility in hospital environments. By testing shape-changing in a real robot prototype, we ensure the findings are applicable in practice. Additionally, this study provides valuable insights for the design and integration of shape-changing behavior to improve human-robot interaction, leading to more legible communication in social robotics.",Master Interaction Technology (M-ITECH),"Ossendrijver, Tom",May 2025,English,"No

We had a two-step methodology. First, we conducted semi-structured interviews with professionals working in the Netherlands to investigate walking meeting perceived barriers. Second, we did a collaborative design study to explore potential solutions. Through the interviews, we identified three key barriers to walking meetings: visual idea generation, text-based idea capturing, and idea sharing. Participants in the collaborative sessions proposed a wide variety of interactive and infrastructural concepts, often involving technologies such as drones, projectors, AI, and audio tools. From this process, we derived nine design guidelines that reflect participants’ recurring preferences and tackle the identified challenges, such as hands-free interaction, the importance of lightweight portable technologies, the usefulness of structured formats that guide the flow of a meeting, and the value of remote walking meetings in hybrid work environments that incorporate tools to enable remote collaboration. These guidelines provide concrete directions for researchers and designers aiming to develop interactive systems and infrastructures that integrate physical movement into knowledge work. Our findings also touch on adjacent domains, including urban design, smart city design, and smart office environments. While our work addresses several core issues in walking meetings, further research is needed to explore challenges related to group scaling, keeping agenda focus, and weather.

However, many existing vision pipelines lack generalization and cannot meet real-time constraints. This study presents a unified framework that combines segmentation, tracking, and stereo-based depth estimation to enable object-level robotic interaction. The framework integrates prompt-based segmentation (SAM2), a zero-shot open-set detector (GroundingDINO), and stereo depth from a ZED Mini camera. It supports both language and spatial prompts and uses a memory-based mechanism to track objects across frames. An optional co-planar refinement module applies RANSAC and WLS-based hybrid plane fitting to improve depth quality within segmented regions. The system is evaluated through robotic grasping experiments under varied conditions, including translucent objects, low-contrast backgrounds, and cluttered scenes, at 720p and 1080p. Results demonstrate accurate segmentation in well-contrasted scenes, consistent object tracking, and reliable depth estimation, with real-time performance maintained above 10 FPS. Depth refinement improves accuracy but adds computational overhead and may oversimplify curved surfaces. While generalization was observed across test cases, all experiments occurred in a controlled lab setting.

However, its interpretation remains qualitative and patient-specific due to variability in arterial input functions (AIFs). This thesis aims to enable quantitative FA by implementing pulse oximeter-based AIF estimation and validating a correction algorithm in phantom experiments. Methods: Two flow phantoms were developed. The first simulated microcirculation using glass beads to generate time-intensity curves (TICs) under varying ICG injection parameters, flow rates, and bead packing densities. The second mimicked pulsatile flow to estimate AIFs using a commercial pulse oximeter. A deconvolution algorithm was developed to correct TICs using the measured AIFs. Results: The microcirculation phantom produced TICs reflecting changes in perfusion and injection parameters. The pulse oximeter captured dynamic ICG signals, but real-time AIF estimation was limited by hardware/software constraints. Deconvolution improved TIC comparability and isolated tissue-specific responses. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of correcting FA measurements using non-invasively estimated AIFs.

This thesis investigates which structural characteristics of machine bureaucracies influence employee change readiness during organizational changes. A qualitative multiple case study was conducted across three organizations undergoing significant change within machine bureaucratic settings. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using thematic coding. Findings show that key structural features—top-down decision-making, rigid hierarchies, hierarchical communication, and an emphasis on efficiency, formalization, and standardization—undermine employee change readiness by limiting perceptions of appropriateness, efficacy, management support, and personal valence. However, structural elements alone do not determine readiness; employees’ daily experiences of these structures proved equally influential. Middle managers played an inconsistent but crucial role in bridging structural gaps, restoring trust and engagement. Additionally, organizational culture moderated these relationships, particularly in international settings where cultural norms around hierarchy shaped perceptions. Change fatigue, reducing motivation and trust in new initiatives, emerged only in one case, suggesting it is not a universal outcome in all machine bureaucracies. This study recommends a multidimensional approach to change management in machine bureaucracies, integrating structural awareness, leadership development, and cultural sensitivity to enhance employee readiness while maintaining efficiency and stability.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Wonnink, N.K.",May 2025,English,"No

By employing an inductive, qualitative comparative case study approach that incorporates semi-structured interviews and open-ended responses, this study examines the perceived positive and negative implications of AI integration on the self-concept, roles, and values of medical professionals. Guided by the Gioia methodology and thematic analysis, the results show that although AI may disrupt traditional task responsibilities, core professional values such as autonomy, ethics, and patient-centred care still remain substantially resilient. This study highlights how professionals engage in identity work to adapt, resist, or redefine their roles by identifying two main dimensions of experience: “mistrust in AI” and “AI-identity work”. Although AI is often viewed as a supportive tool rather than a threat, the emotional and cultural framing of AI’s influence varies across different contexts. While the South Korean participant frames AI as a collaborative asset, Dutch professionals often place more emphasis on scepticism regarding autonomy. By revealing how internal, organisational, and cultural factors influence identity responses, the study theoretically adds to the body of literature on identity work.

106320,"Analysis of user needs and preferences regarding mobility hub features, services and amenities",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106320,"In response to rising urban challenges such as congestion, air pollution, space inefficiency and car 
dependency, mobility hubs have emerged as a promising solution to increase sustainable and inclusive 
transport. These intermodal stations combine shared mobility services and public transport with 
supportive amenities and digital infrastructure. This thesis investigates how mobility hubs can be better 
designed and composed to meet the needs and preferences of both users and non-users of shared 
mobility, particularly in car-dependent contexts. 
Using a survey distributed across five cities in North Holland, the research analyses user intentions, 
preferences, and socio-demographic influences on mobility hub usage. Despite widespread awareness 
of mobility hubs, actual intention to use shared mobility services remains limited, primarily due to a 
preference for private vehicles and a perceived mismatch with personal travel needs. However, there 
is strong interest in other mobility hub amenities, such as seating, parcel lockers, secure bicycle parking, 
and car parking, which appeal to both users and non-users alike. These findings suggest that mobility 
hubs offer broader community value beyond facilitating shared mobility.

106319,Navigating the Energy Transition : A Digital Transformation Strategy Framework for Fuel Stations,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106319,"The fuel station industry is undergoing significant disruption due to the global energy transition, regulatory changes, and shifting customer demands. The demand for fossil fuels is declining, making traditional business models unsustainable. Fuel station companies are being forced to adapt and need to find new revenue streams. Digital transformation is necessary to remain competitive and needs to be a priority. However, existing digital
transformation strategy frameworks lack industry-specific considerations for fuel stations. This research aims to develop a tailored digital transformation strategy framework that guides practitioners through the challenges of the energy transition by answering strategic questions. Using the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM), the study integrates insights from a systematic literature review and semi-structured interviews with industry experts. The findings reveal that key barriers to transformation include resistance to change, financial constraints, regulatory complexity, and technological implementation. Opposite, opportunities exist in mobility hubs, alternative fuels, AI-driven automation, and data-driven business models.
As a result, this research introduces the PITSTOP framework, a structured approach that guides fuel stations through their digital transformation journey. The framework incorporates key elements such as policy alignment, technological innovation, and structural
adaptation. Validation through expert interviews confirms its relevance and applicability, though further case studies and refinements are recommended. This study contributes to the limited academic literature on digital transformation in the fuel retail industry and provides a practical tool for industry stakeholders to navigate the evolving landscape.

106318,Practical Probabilistic Program Verification using Caesar,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106318,"This thesis explores the practical verification of probabilistic programs using Caesar, a weakest preexpectation-based verification tool for reasoning about the expected behaviour of discrete probabilistic programs. The Bounded Retransmission Protocol (BRP) is studied as a case study. A key contribution of this work is the abstraction and decomposition of BRP into two geometric-like programs, enabling more effective reasoning about the protocol's behaviour and facilitating the stepwise verification strategy. Theoretical verification of key properties (positive almost-sure termination, success probability, and the expectation of the number of failed and sent transmissions) was largely successful using weakest preexpectation calculus.
Translating these results into verification using Caesar introduced practical challenges, particularly in invariant discovery. Additionally, even valid invariants did not always lead to successful verification due to limitations in Caesar’s current implementation, particularly in SMT solver performance and the handling of exponentials.  However, through workarounds including alternative invariants and a 'fueled' exponential function, meaningful properties of BRP were verified. This thesis demonstrates how such techniques support practical verification in Caesar and concludes with a discussion of its strengths, limitations, and recommendations for effective use.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Jaarsveld, Franka van",May 2025,English,"No

These essential cycling skills include decision-making at intersections (DMI), hazard perception (HP), gap acceptance (GA) and morally acceptable cycling behavior (MACB). 
Using a descriptive and explanatory approach, an analysis was conducted with data collected in 2020 and 2022 from the WEVER test. The analysis examined the demonstration of each higher-order cycling skill, bike use, and collision involvement across years and provinces in the Netherlands. Furthermore, the impact of perceived traffic education at school and at home on higher-order cycling skills was investigated. Finally, the role of traffic education and cycling skills in predicting collision involvement was analyzed. The overarching goal was to provide insights into how traffic education contributes to the development of higher-order cycling skills and the safety of young cyclists.
The findings suggest that many children still lack fundamental cycling skills. Formal traffic education is paradoxically associated with a higher collision risk, while informal traffic reduces it. Given schools’ important role in the development of HOCS and the implementation of traffic education curricula, there is a clear need to analyze and assess traffic education curricula due to their contribution to cycling safety and skill development. Furthermore, initiatives to support parents in educating their children on each of the four HOCS to help reduce unsafe traffic situations may be beneficial.",Master Educational Science and Technology (M-EST),"Xhauflair, Marie",May 2025,English,"No.

Our system uses bi-directional connectionless communication to broadcast messages containing position information to nearby bikes. To determine the possible use cases of our communication design, we evaluated with practical measurements different sets of BLE parameters and compared them with the analytical model from previous research. By doing so, we confirmed that scan window duration and synchronization are critical factors for optimal message delivery.

enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by
leveraging query enrichment through knowledge graphs. RAG
systems, which combine retrieval mechanisms with generative
models, are powerful tools for answering complex queries by
incorporating external knowledge. However, these systems often
face challenges in domain-specific contexts where embedding
models may lack the precision required to retrieve relevant
information. This limitation is particularly significant in specialized domains, such as finance and biomedicine, where nuanced
understanding is essential.
Our approach addresses this gap by employing a Large
Language Model (LLM) not only as the engine powering the
RAG system but also as a tool for extracting structured triplets
during both the ingestion and querying phases. These triplets,
stored in a knowledge graph, are injected into queries during
inference to generate enriched and contextually aware inputs,
improving the precision of the retrieval process.
We evaluate the proposed method on three datasets: a generaldomain dataset with question-answer pairs from Wikipedia and
two domain-specific datasets in finance and biomedicine, each
comprising approximately 8,000 document chunks. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall with an improvement of up 5% for the precision
metric, 19% for the recall and an overall increase of on average
7% in the generative quality of the output, as well as enhanced
relevance and coherence in the system-generated answers. These
findings highlight the potential of knowledge graphs to bridge
gaps in embedding precision and improve overall performance

It is expected to affect 14 million people worldwide by 2040, which is more than a quadruplication since 1990. Diagnosis is currently based on symptoms, but biomarker detection might allow for earlier and more accurate diagnosis. This master’s assignment has been a step in the development of a method to quantitatively detect αS fibrils – the protein aggregates that characterize Parkinson’s disease. The novel method combines two existing techniques: the sensitive but non-quantitative method of seeded aggregation assay (SAA) and single particle counting (SPC). The SAA amplifies the number of αS fibrils, and SPC quantifies single fibrils. Measuring the αS fibril increase over time yields a doubling time, which can be used to find the αS fibril amount in original patient sample. This would not only allow for quantitative diagnosis, but also the monitoring of disease progression which supports treatment development. An SPC setup in which αS fibrils can be counted during an SAA was successfully constructed and tested. Various parameters were investigated for optimization, such as the αS fibril concentration, the mechanical sonication of αS fibrils, and type of fluorescent dye staining the αS fibrils.

This study investigated Belief in a Just World (BJW), a concept that assumes that individuals generally get what they deserve in life. It was hypothesized that the relationship between BJW and acceptance towards restorative justice (DV1) and punitive sentencing (DV2) is mediated by internal and external attributions to crime. A convenience sample of predominantly German citizens (N = 123) completed an online survey assessing BJW, attributions of criminal responsibility, attitudes towards restorative justice, and punitive sentencing. Results revealed internal attributions mediating BJW and punitive sentencing, while external attributions fully mediated BJW and acceptance towards restorative justice. Specifically, individuals believing the world is a just place attributed crime to more internal factors and less to external factors, leading them to favour punitiveness more and accept restorative justice less. These results illuminate how societal beliefs about justness and attributional processes foster systemic injustice.

For this study, it was hypothesized that victims of a cyber-threat would be less willing to participate in VOM than victims of an offline threat. It was further proposed that this relationship was mediated by fear towards the offender, perceived seriousness, and/or self-blame. Participants were asked to imagine themselves as victims of either a cyber-threat or an offline-threat, before measuring the proposed mediator variables as well as willingness to participate in VOM. Although willingness to participate in VOM did not significantly differ between the two conditions, it was relatively high overall in our sample.

This study investigates the design, fabrication, and validation of a static cardiac phantom featuring a flexible insert, specifically developed to support the training and improvement of biopsy procedures. The iterative design process focused primarily on optimizing the phantom, with particular attention given to the flexible septum. The resulting phantom underwent a series of assessments to evaluate its anatomically realism, biopsy compatibility, and suitability for iCMR training. Tests were conducted using an ablation catheter, with real-time tracking of the catheter’s movement. MRI-based testing confirmed the phantom’s functionality, demonstrating both its anatomical realism and effective catheter tracking. Biopsy compatibility was tested and flow testing further validated the septum’s ability to remain in place under conditions corresponding to normal heart stroke volume.

Through semi-structured interviews with sixteen entrepreneurs from various sectors, the study reveals that SMEs demonstrated high levels of resilience, adaptability, and quick decision-making to manage changing market conditions, financial uncertainty, and consumer behaviour. Firms in volatile sectors like retail and hospitality leaned towards effectuation, benefiting from flexibility and reduced risk through a focus on affordable losses. In contrast, SMEs in more stable sectors such as healthcare, real estate, and professional services relied on causation for long-term, structured planning. Many SMEs adopted a hybrid approach, blending long-term goals with agile responses to sudden changes—especially in digital and e-commerce sectors. Resilience, supported by financial buffers, digitalisation, and diverse income streams, was key to survival and growth.

This study aims to clarify the multifaceted benefits of UGS within the broader Planetary Health framework, recognizing the conceptual fragmentation that often impedes effective planning and implementation. Adopting a multidisciplinary lens, the research integrates insights from environmental science, urban planning, and public health. A scoping review of 81 academic articles was conducted using the snowballing method to identify key concepts, benefits, and mechanisms associated with UGS.

The findings show that awareness of the register is low—only 12.1% of respondents were familiar with it—and varies significantly by education and age. While respondents generally support transparency efforts, they emphasize that real transparency requires more than access to information. Specifically, they want understandable explanations of how decisions are made, what data is used, and which factors influence outcomes. The current register falls short in this regard: it provides limited accessible information and lacks explainability altogether. These shortcomings highlight a broader disconnect between the policy's intention and its practical effect.

It further examines the role of transparency in consumer acceptance and evaluates how AI-generated celebrity endorsement, product-celebrity congruency, and transparency influence attitude toward the advertisement, purchase intention, and advertisement recall.
Hypotheses: It was hypothesized that AI-generated celebrity endorsement, product-celebrity congruency, and transparency would positively influence attitude toward the advertisement and purchase intention, with AI-generated celebrity endorsement and product-celebrity congruency also positively influencing advertisement recall. Additionally, participants' attitude toward AI was expected to moderate the effects of celebrity endorsement and congruency on advertisement attitudes.
Methods: A partially nested factorial experimental design was employed. Data was collected through an online experiment and analyzed using one-way ANOVAs and multiple linear regression.
Results: Findings revealed that attitude toward AI had a significant direct effect on both purchase intention and attitude toward the advertisement. Additionally, AI-generated celebrity endorsement negatively affected advertisement recall. Transparency was found to moderate the relationship between AI-generated celebrity endorsement and attitude toward the advertisement.
Discussion and Conclusion: AI-generated Celebrity endorsement, product-celebrity congruency, and transparency did not show direct significant effects on attitude toward the advertisement or purchase intention.

106293,Understanding the characteristics of an innovative top management team and designing a tool to discuss power dynamics,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106293,"Top management teams (TMTs) are critical in facilitating innovation and attaining organisational success. In previous studies, demographic diversity within TMTs has generally been associated with fostering organisational innovativeness. Conversely, while the positive effect of diversity on innovation is well documented, this paper also highlights the partial responsibility of diversity within TMTs for inequality amongst team members. Power imbalances resulting from inequality within a team have been demonstrated to harm collaboration and innovation. The starting point of this study is this so-called 'diversity/inequality dilemma'. In the study, an in-depth exploration of the configuration strategies employed by innovative TMTs to overcome the adverse effects of the aforementioned dilemma is performed. Furthermore, during the study a practical tool was designed to support TMT in addressing power dynamics and improving collaboration to drive innovation.

clothing. This has resulted in a lot of plastic waste, of which 90% is not properly disposed. Therefore these 
plastics end up in landfills and environments, resulting in the formation of micro- and nanoplastics 
(MNPs) through degradation due to the environment. Humans come into contact with these MNPs by 
consuming food and drinks contaminated with MNPs, or by inhaling air containing MNPs. There is little 
known information about MNP exposure in the lungs as there are currently no models that accurately 
represent the in vivo environment of the lungs. This research focuses on the influence of MNPs on lung 
epithelial cells by using a novel lung-on-a-chip system in comparison with the Transwell system, the 
standard model. This was done by firstly investigating the optimal cell seeding density within a well plate 
and a static lung-on-a-chip (StatLoC) covered with Gelatin methacrylate and comparing the difference in 
cell characteristics. This is done with the goal of optimizing cell culturing within the StatLoC, which will be 
compared to the Transwell system. Finally, the influence of micro-and nanoplastics is studied by adding 
MNPs to the Transwell and StatLoC systems and comparing the results. Results show that the optimal cell 
seeding density within the StatLoC system is 5*105 cells/cm2 and that MNPs with 0.2 μm diameter have 
the greatest potential of crossing cell membranes. However, these results have limited relevance as the 
StatLoC chip needs more optimization, specifically regarding Gelatin Methacrylate fragmentation and 
detachment, before it can reliably be used to replace the Transwell system for lung-on-chip research.",Bachelor Biomedical Engineering (B-BMT),"Kooten, S.L.C. van",January 2024,English,"No.

One such architecture is called racetrack, a type of non-volatile memory storing data in a nanowire. It is of particular interest due to its high density, low power consumption and fast access times. However, to integrate such memory into real-world applications, a complete compilation flow is essential.

Research shows that racism negatively affects mental health, and racialised persons—those assigned characteristics based on phenotypical attributes or stereotypes—are frequent targets of racism. This pilot study explores the experiences and perceptions of racialised individuals in Germany amid these political changes. Data were manually collected from Reddit posts and comments around the 2025 election, yielding 94 pseudonymised entries.

106282,Problem formulation in organizational change : A systematic literature review,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106282,"Background: Organisational change is a complex process, encompassing various
 steps. It is often observed that change initiatives can be ineffective or fail (Balogun and Hailey, 2004; Sturdy and Grey, 2003). Scholars often associate the success of changes with understanding the problems (Burnes, 1996; Nutt, 1998; Pashiardis, 1995). Considering the above, to better understand organisational changes, it is important to begin with how organisational problems requiring change are approached. Method: Using a systematic literature review as a research method, this study paused the following research questions: How does extant research conceptualise problem formulation; what are the main findings of extant research in terms of what the straightforward/challenging parts problem formulation are, and which factors affect the problem formulation; How did extant research study the process of problem formulation. The search query developed for this study was applied in the Web of Science database, yielding 1,207 articles, of which nine were included in the final review. The coding of the publications involved both inductive and deductive processes. Prior to coding, the articles were assessed for quality. Inter-rater reliability was 91% for the quality assessment and 77% for the coding
 process. Results: The results indicate that problem formulation is conceptualised as socially
constructed, iterative, complex, and multifaceted. When conceptualising problem formulation, researchers adopt either a structured or interpretive approach. The chosen approach is linked to the research method employed. Specifically, it is found that researchers who view problem formulation through a structured lens utilise quantitative methods, while those who approach it through an interpretive lens use qualitative methods. Creative logic, sensemaking, leadership behaviour, project experience, and knowledge were identified as influential factors, all of which were grouped under the theme of cognition.

The core problem identified is the absence of a valuation framework that reflects the unique dynamics of the Western European market. Through a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research, the study first identified key valuation drivers via expert questionnaires. This was followed by a financial analysis of 28 public SaaS firms across Western Europe from 2015–2024. The model estimates company valuation using ARR and adjusts for private companies via a discount based on an integrated private company discount. Regression analyses helped correct the model based on ARR growth rates. Findings show a growing alignment between U.S. and Western European SaaS valuations, though key market differences remain.

parameter influencing their effectiveness. However, the absence of clinical guidelines for tuning AFO stiffness often results in inconsistent outcomes and low user satisfaction. This may be due to two key challenges: the limited number of gait variables considered, which may not capture the full complexity of walking, and variability in how stiffness relates to gait variables across
individuals.
To address these challenges, we propose a user-tailored optimization framework that identifies and incorporates relevant gait variables based on individual needs and preferences. First, key performance variables across five gait domains were examined in five participants with cerebral palsy to assess their relevance for predicting stiffness levels, using SHapley Additive exPlanations
(SHAP) to interpret feature importance. Subsequently, user
and healthcare professional preferences were integrated into the stiffness optimization framework.
Our findings highlight the importance of multiple performance variables in capturing gait complexity and reveal that the most relevant variables differ between participants.

 has become the largest market for wind turbines. That part of the world is unfortunately subject to multiple
 typhoons each year, a natural disaster that can destroy entire communities. The extreme wind speeds that
 occur in these storms can easily damage or dismantle wind turbines. This represents a huge risk that has to
 be taken into account when designing a turbine that would be located there. 2B-Energy is a company based in
 Hengelo which designed and implemented a downwind two-bladed wind turbine, the 2B6 turbine, installed in
 Eemshaven (The Netherlands). As the Asian market shows much potential, having a strong load management
 strategy to preserve the turbine is crucial when installed in an area prone to tropical cyclones. The strategy
 investigated concerns the position of the rotor during extreme wind speeds, which can be left idling or parked.
 To assess the optimal configuration, aeroelastic simulations were ran to determine which option could potentially
 have the lower loading on the different wind turbine components. For these simulations, different wind fields
 were generated in order to simulate a typhoon. Some of the parameters implemented in the wind field were
 based on experimental data of typhoon Yagi from 2024. The simulation results pointed out different behavioral
 differences between the idling and parked rotor. The parked configuration lead to a large yaw misalignment
 while the idling configuration caused larger loads. A static rotor position seems to avoid the most extreme
 loading on the turbine’s components. To implement this particular strategy, different design consideration such
 as the use of an active yaw mechanism need to be further investigated as simply locking the rotor, when having

A variety of scientific methods starting from conventional supervised and unsupervised classifiers to machine and deep learning classifiers has been utilized to perform crop type classification from remote sensing images. In reality an agricultural field appears to have a lot of majority crops with a few scattered minority crops in a particular cropping season. Generally, crop classification studies ignore these minority crops or gather them together into a class called other crops and carry out classification. This study is aimed at providing a solution for the problem of class imbalance that occurs in deep learning based classification. Owing to the limited availability of labelled data, a 1D CNN sequential deep learning model is selected. The study area chosen is Jhansi District in the Bundelkhand Region of Uttar Pradesh in India. Sentinel 2 freely accessible optical data with a high spatial resolution of 10 m is chosen for the study. Taking into account the Rabi Season, 23 multi-temporal Sentinel 2 images covering Rabi crop season is considered. The majority crop class identified is wheat and the minority crop classes identified are mustard and chickpea. The Hyper-parameter of the model is optimized through Bayesian Optimization.
Two approaches are considered in this study to address the problem of class imbalance. They are algorithm level balancing techniques and data level balancing techniques. Cost sensitive learning is introduced in the 1D CNN model by making changes to the loss function. Three different loss functions such as categorical cross entropy, focal loss and class weighted loss are employed to arrive at one best loss function that can solve imbalance problem in crop classification. Secondly, data level balancing methods such as under sampling, oversampling and hybrid methods (combination of under sampling and oversampling) are applied to the training dataset and the 1D CNN model is trained and tested with these balanced dataset. The results are assessed based on accuracy metrics such as Overall Accuracy, F1 –score, Precision, and Recall. G-Mean score is preferred to assess the accuracy of individual classes as it is proved to be utilized in imbalanced classification problem.
It was observed that class weighted loss performed the best out of all loss functions with an overall accuracy of 70.37 % and a G-Mean score of 56.24%. When it comes to data level balancing techniques, under sampling outperformed oversampling as it lead to the generation new incorrect artificial samples. After carefully interpreting the results of both these techniques, and comparing those with sampling techniques algorithm level balancing with class weighted loss was chosen to be the best out of all the different methods incorporated to solve the imbalance in the classification problem.

106265,The Politics of Impoliteness : An Analysis of Political Discourse and the Adherence to Democratic Norms in the Netherlands,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106265,"Democracies worldwide have faced increasing pressures in recent years, with many experiencing a decline in democratic freedoms and a shift toward authoritarianism. The presidency of Donald J. Trump (2016–2020) reignited global debates on democratic resilience, highlighting the role of democratic norms—mutual toleration and institutional forbearance—as critical safeguards against democratic erosion. Building on the theoretical framework of Levitsky and Ziblatt (How Democracies Die), this study examines the state of democratic norms in the Netherlands following the end of pacification politics. 
This research investigates how transformations in media and technology have influenced Dutch political discourse and whether key democratic norms have been upheld or eroded over time. By conducting a content and discourse analysis of political statements from two distinct periods (1967–1987 and 2004–2024), this study identifies shifts in the nature and frequency of norm violations. The findings suggest that the rise of social media has not only facilitated broader and faster dissemination of political statements but has also contributed to the fragmentation and polarization of public debate.

While current solutions focus on mitigating inactivity, they often overlook the core issue: the design of digital tools, which prioritize efficiency over embodied interaction. This research investigates how spatial computing can reintroduce embodied skills into office work through a research-through-design approach across three iterative cycles. These cycles included contextual inquiries with office workers and craftspeople, co-design bodystorming sessions, and prototype development. The study identified key contrasts between craft and office work—especially in spatial use and tangible interaction—which inspired multiple design concepts. One, “Spatial Git,” allows developers to visualize and manipulate code branches in physical space, echoing craft-based spatial organization. However, participants rarely saw interactions with Spatial Git as skilful, underscoring a broader challenge: embodied skill cannot be designed directly into MR systems but must develop through ongoing practice. This research highlights the difficulty of fostering sensorimotor coupling in MR and suggests designers should create conditions for skill emergence rather than prescribing fixed actions. It contributes to embodied interaction discourse and positions spatial computing as a promising, underexplored avenue for transforming digital work into a more physically engaged practice.",Master Interaction Technology (M-ITECH),"Wintermans, L.J.",April 2025,English,"No

The study types included in the review were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, and observational research designs. 
Results from the review indicated that mHealth interventions using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and sound therapy applications were the most frequently utilized types of intervention design. Across a combined sample of 606 participants, the interventions exhibited significant reductions in tinnitus severity. Outcomes were measured with validated instruments such as the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI).

Diagnostic imaging, such as lumbar spine X-rays (LSXs), can help identify the cause of LBP. However, radiologist interpretation of these X-rays can be time-consuming and variable. Artificial intelligence may assist in addressing these challenges. We aimed to develop a vision-language model for automatic Dutch radiology report generation for LSXs, based on the Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLaVA) architecture. We compared original components (CLIP, Vicuna) with the PubMedCLIP vision encoder and the Dutch GEITje language model, assessed different image preprocessing techniques, and evaluated single- versus multi-turn datasets. Performance was validated using BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, alongside radiologist assessment of clinical correctness and impact on patient management. The GEITje-PubMedCLIP model, trained on multi-turn data with zero-padded images, achieved the best results (e.g., BLEU-1 0.0830, METEOR 0.1820, ROUGE-L 0.1518). Radiologist evaluation showed only 20% of reports matched radiologist findings, and 40% would lead to incorrect patient management, mainly due to misidentification of vertebral fractures and spondylolisthesis.

This is especially so in non-linear radar systems that rely on non-linear properties of the target to produce a return signal at a frequency different from that of the illuminating signals. The aim of this thesis is to improve the coverage area of an existing non-linear harmonic radar setup through the utilisation of multiple auxiliary transmitters (helpers) and the optimisation of their placement. Using the same power budget and equal transmit power distribution, the results presented in this work indicate that adding one helper transmitter increases coverage area by roughly 35.8% in comparison to the stand-alone conventional harmonic radar system. Coverage area can increase with 37.0%, 44.4%, 54.3% and 59.3%, by utilising 2, 3, 4 and 5 helper nodes, respectively. Using multiple low-power transmitters is less costly than a single high-power transmitter, making the use of auxiliary transmitters a more cost-effective solution to increase coverage area.",Bachelor Electrical Engineering (B-EE),"Capitano, Alfonso",April 2025,English,"No

Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted on a dataset consisting of three interviews with eleven training participants. A combination of deductive coding, using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, and inductive coding was applied to reveal factors that influenced implementation. Next, recommendations were created which were validated with VR therapists via an online questionnaire. Results: Most areas of improvement were identified within the innovation and inner setting domain. Organisations are recommended to thoroughly inform future VR therapists and consider setting post-training requirements; increase organisational knowledge about VR; provide (practical) support; actively stimulate VR use; provide a clear vision on VR; and integrate VR in standard processes. The validation showed that participants considered these recommendations to be important for VR implementation.

First, simple structures reduce distance between employees and the central leader, enhancing perceptions of management support and appropriateness. Second, differing levels of involvement in coordination and decentralisation result in varying employee roles and attitudes, which can positively or negatively affect readiness depending on individual experiences. Third, the strategic apex’s focus on core operational activities, along with overlapping employee roles, fosters a sense of efficacy and perceived management support. Notably, personal valence was not influenced by structure, while organisational culture moderated many relationships. The central leader’s style and behaviour emerged as crucial to shaping employee change readiness.

Studies indicate that there is a significant number of Gen Z employees that want to quit their jobs within two years, which means that it is important for organizations to redevelop their management strategies and adapt to the characteristics and values of Gen Z. This thesis explores how Gen Z’s work values and boundary management preferences impact their well-being in the Dutch digital workforce. Using an inductive qualitative approach, 17 semi-structured interviews were conducted across different generational cohorts, with the focus on Gen Z employees. Data analysis was performed thematically to identify patterns in work values, boundary management, digital connectivity, and well-being. The results of this study reveal that Gen Z particularly values freedom, flexibility and autonomy, which encourages work-life integration.

Cognitive psychologists have tested multiple approaches to “gamify” validated tasks. However, there is no consistent framework for the development of such academic task and there is a lack of consensus on how validated tasks can be “gamified”. Furthermore, game elements must be applied with care, as ludic games often present elements that conflict with the validity of a task. This thesis investigates how game design can be applied to a game version of a property verification task for cognitive psychology to increase ecological validity while maintaining experimental validity. This game was developed in a collaborative setting with three cognitive psychology researchers with no prior experience with academic games, and two experts of academic games as participants to the collaboration, using direct feedback in four iterative feedback cycles. The entire collaborative development was documented, including design rationale, iterative changes, and collaboration challenges. Adding narrative elements and game-like elements such as 3D environments and game-UI to cognitive tasks could help generate ecological validity without sacrificing experimental validity.

106241,StegaScanMail : Enhancing Email Security with Deep Learning Cloud-Based Image Steganography Detection,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106241,"As security technologies and practices evolve, so do attackers’ techniques to exploit
potential informatic vulnerabilities. One recent trend that is on the rise is steganogra-
phy. Digital steganography studies communication in which secret messages are concealed
in other unsuspicious forms, such as images, audio files, or documents. Steganalysis is
a study focused on detecting the existence of secret messages inserted into digital media
using steganography. When steganography is used, attacks can occur in several forms.
Image steganography is the most commonly used technique because of the frequent usage
of images on the Internet and a wide variety of formats and compression techniques. An
attack can take the form of a hidden executable file inside an image, which starts an at-
tack in the background when the image is clicked. This type of cyberattack has targeted
higher governing bodies and international companies, such as energy companies in Central
Asia (Kazakhstan and Mongolia), public sector entities in Southeast Asia (Japan, Viet-
nam, and Indonesia), and the Azerbaijan government. The attacks were initiated through
electronic mail, which was used to transmit the modified digital media and payload to vic-
tims’ workstations. Existing image steganalysis tools, such as Aperi’Solve or StegoHunt,
do not cover email extensively and usually require manually passing the image, increasing
the associated threats, such as malware infections or data breaches. Email providers, such
as Outlook or Gmail, do not specifically mention performing image steganalysis, although
these services are used by most businesses worldwide. This research proposes a deep learn-
ing Python-based tool named StegaScanMail, which can be deployed in the cloud as a
Docker container. StegaScanMail performs steganalysis on images in received emails using
a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies both greyscale and RGB images. Ste-
gaScanMail’s functionality targets and has been trained mainly with the portable network
graphics (PNG) format of images encoded with the least significant bit (LSB) technique
because malicious actors frequently use this technique due to its simplicity and effectiveness
in avoiding detection. The training and testing of StegaScanMail were performed mainly
using the Stego-Images-Dataset, which contains 44 000 PNG images embedded with mali-
cious code. The PNG image format is often found in emails because of its frequent use in
logos and web graphics. Email, which is now widely adopted and is increasingly hosted in
the cloud, is highly susceptible to cyberattacks. Its extensive use, particularly in business

106239,From abstract to accessible : developing a tool to aid knowledge dissemination within the Dutch tax administration,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106239,"For the past three years, a small, dedicated team within the Dutch Tax Administration has researched ways to improve connections with society as a governmental organisation. This thesis aims to support the ‘Connecting to Society’ team by developing a tool that enhances their knowledge base, making it more comprehensible and accessible to diverse stakeholders both internally and externally. Additionally, the thesis explores how such a tool can facilitate knowledge dissemination across various disciplinary fields.
The approach to this design challenge is primarily rooted in the philosophy of phenomenology and systemic design. This provided a structured yet flexible methodology that guided the exploration of the research question. The exploration phase yielded valuable insights on how knowledge travels through the organisation, explored through the lens of the experiences of involved stakeholders. In conjunction with relevant literature, these insights were translated into five practical design criteria. These criteria formed the foundation for the final design: the Harmonica.
The Harmonica is a compact and portable tool that combines visual and tangible elements to translate the team’s knowledge into structured yet flexible formats. Its design fosters interactive discussions with stakeholders and is adaptable for future use. Grounded in the five criteria—embodiment of process and outcomes, improved packaging, imagination stimulation, stakeholder interconnection, and embracing disciplinary diversity—the Harmonica effectively addresses the challenges of knowledge dissemination within complex organisational settings.
This project not only demonstrates the potential of industrial design engineering in addressing sociotechnical challenges but also highlights the field’s adaptability to dynamic and interdisciplinary contexts, further developing the concepts of industrial design as we understand them. The insights and practical outcomes presented in this thesis provide valuable guidance for similar initiatives in organisations alike.",Master Industrial Design Engineering (M-IDE),"Storm, M.B.",May 2025,English,"No

free electricity. But the highly radioactive environment inside a nuclear power plant
makes it very dangerous for humans to maintain it. An important component of a
nuclear power plant that needs frequent maintenance is a steam generator that con-
verts water into steam and acts as a heat exchanger. In this thesis, a manipulator
named UR16e from Universal Robots is used to reach the position where mainte-
nance is required inside the steam generator compartment using deep reinforcement
learning. The steam generator compartment has a narrow opening called a manway
to enter it which makes the environment confined. A reward function is designed
to achieve the desired position and orientation of the end-effector without collisions
between the robot and the steam generator walls using proximal policy optimization
algorithm. With simulation results, it is shown that a multi-objective reward func-
tion leads to unintended results. Using hierarchical reinforcement learning in this
problem improves the results by breaking down the original goal into subgoals and
designing separate reward functions for each subgoal. Lastly, curriculum learning

106231,Shades of Emotion : How Colour Warmth and Congruency Shape Brainwaves and Emotions,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106231,"Colour perception plays a crucial role in emotional and cognitive processing, influencing fields such as fashion, marketing, and design. This study examined the neural and self-reported emotional responses to warm, cool, and congruent colour combinations among young adults (N = 25) aged 18–30. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to record neural responses, including event-related potentials (ERPs) and frequency power (alpha and beta bands) in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Participants were tested individually in a controlled laboratory setting using a within-subject design. During the experiment, each participant viewed a series of colour slides on-screen, corresponding to the three experimental conditions (warm, cool, congruent), while wearing EEG caps.
Following the EEG task, participants completed a self-report questionnaire. This included the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) for each condition, capturing changes in emotional affect. Additionally, the questionnaire contained items assessing visual attractiveness, aesthetic balance, satisfaction, harmony, and colour complementarity in response to the congruent colour combinations.
Results indicated that warm colours significantly increased alpha power in both the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, suggesting a modulation of cognitive and emotional processing rather than heightened arousal. Contrary to traditional theories, cool colours did not significantly increase positive emotions, but were associated with a significant decrease in negative affect—suggesting a reduction in discomfort rather than an actively calming or uplifting effect. Congruent colour combinations did not produce the expected emotional balance. Instead, participants reported higher levels of visual complexity and cognitive load, as measured by self-report items on harmony and complementarity.
Methodological limitations, including the fixed order of stimulus presentation and the spatial positioning of congruent colours, may have influenced results. Additionally, ERP responses occur within 100-200 ms, making precise stimulus timing critical for neural accuracy. Future research should consider counterbalancing stimulus presentation and comparing generational differences in colour perception to assess potential shifts caused by prolonged digital exposure.
These findings challenge traditional assumptions about colour–emotion associations, suggesting that such theories may not fully apply within contemporary visual environments shaped by digital saturation. The study offers practical implications for industries that rely on colour psychology, such as fashion and branding, and highlights the need to develop updated models of colour perception that account for evolving cognitive, technological, and cultural influences.

A key mechanism governing this behaviour is the Rayleigh-Plateau instability, where surface tension forces cause a liquid column to fragment into droplets. This thesis investigates jet breakup dynamics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations alongside machine learning (ML) models to accelerate predictions. Traditional CFD simulations, based on the Navier-Stokes equations for a thin axisymmetric liquid jet, are computationally expensive, posing challenges for real-time applications. To address this, surrogate ML models are explored as a faster alternative while maintaining predictive accuracy. Training data is generated through CFD simulations, with a particular focus on the Ohnesorge number, which influences droplet formation dynamics. The results are validated through comparisons with amplitude analysis based on the Rayleigh–Plateau instability and other numerical methods. Fully connected neural networks (FNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are employed to predict droplet formation and jet breakup.

However, this method of learning possesses some challenges. Many students struggle to maintain focus in high-distraction environments. Research indicates that the use of BCI systems to monitor engagement during online learning can keep the users engaged. These methods, however, often rely on auditory and visual feedback, which compete for the same cognitive resources needed for online learning. To address this limitation, this study investigates how haptic feedback can be used to enhance sustained attention during online learning. By integrating BCI with haptic feedback, real-time engagement monitoring and intervention can be used to potentially improve learner focus. An experiment was conducted with ten university students who watched a 35-minute online lecture under three conditions: no feedback, vibrotactile feedback, and thermal feedback. Their sustained attention, or engagement, was measured by the engagement index using an EEG headset. While the study analyzed the mean engagement index across feedback modalities, no significant differences were found between them. Some participants noted that the haptic feedback worked distracting, which could explain the lack of a significant difference.",Master Interaction Technology (M-ITECH),"Kamp, Stijn",April 2025,English,"No

This study investigated differences in perceived social presence and meeting effectiveness across VR, MS Teams, and F2F at CGI. Using a repeated-measures design, seven participants took part in the same meeting across all three modalities. Data were collected through an adapted version of the Networked Minds Social Presence Inventory and structured observations. Repeated Measures ANOVA and Linear Mixed Models showed that F2F scored highest, followed by MS Teams, with VR scoring significantly lower—especially in co-presence and affective understanding. Observations revealed limited interaction and non-verbal cues in VR. These results were linked to technical constraints, including outdated hardware and lack of facial or eye tracking.

106225,Coercive Control in intimate relationships: A cross-cultural study of Perceptions and Blame Attribution,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106225,"Coercive control is a form of intimate partner violence where, in an intimate relationship, one of the partners shows patterns of oppressive behavior that seeks to control, manipulate, isolate, degrade and intimidate the other. This study aims to investigate the different perceptions on Severity of Abuse, Acceptance and Blame Attribution for coercive control of individuals belonging to two different countries and cultures, namely the Netherlands (dignity culture) and Guatemala (honor culture). Different nationalities and cultural norms can lead to different perceptions. For instance, dignity cultures focus on the value of the individual and its autonomy, while honor cultures focus on maintaining social respect with more rigid roles. Such cultures are very different in the way they deal with conflict and might thus appraise coercive control differently. For this study, participants evaluated a case of a heteronormative relationship in which one of the partners demonstrated coercive control behavior. Participants were randomly assigned to a case with either a female victim or a male victim without any further changes to the contents of the case. Participants were also asked about their Gender Role Beliefs, Perceived Dignity Cultural Norms and Perceived Honor Cultural Norms through different scales. This study concluded that male victims were comparatively blamed more while their victimhood was also deemed less severe and more accepted compared to a female victim. Additionally, Dutch individuals blamed victims more compared to Guatemalans and showed more acceptance of coercive control. All tested moderators also appeared to have a significant effect on at least one of the investigated perceptions. The results of this study address culture and its impact on how people appraise cases of abuse. This perspective is key to get a more overarching approach that can improve legislation and the design of preventive measures, such as a holistic training for authorities and more targeted educational programs that challenge traditional gender stereotypes.

While extensive literature exists on the technical and economic benefits of AI, limited attention has been paid to the role of employee expectations during the pre-implementation phase.

Grounded in the context of Industry 4.0 and drawing upon concepts form social cognitive theory and digital readiness, this study adopts a qualitative, single case research design. Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted across multiple planning-related departments to understand how employees perceive AI technologies and how these perceptions act as enablers or barriers to adoption. 
The findings reveal a nuanced spectrum of employee attitudes, ranging from optimism about AI's potential to concerns regarding its impact on roles, decision-making, and organizational culture. The analysis underscores that positive expectations alone are insufficient; alignment between organizational readiness and individual agency plays a critical role in adoption success.

These procedures are, however, not without risk. There is a chance that improper control of the endoscope by the endoscopist, caused by a lack of information about the robot's surroundings, can cause the endoscope to perforate the walls of an organ, which is life-threatening. This thesis presents an 8 DOF tendon continuum robot, that is capable of avoiding the walls of the organ its passing through. It has 24 optical reflective sensors on the robot's sides, pointed outwards in four sets of six. These sense the robot's surroundings up to a distance of 3.5 cm, with a field of view of 40.8 degrees per sensor. Two control methods evaluated: 1) A PID controller that controlled the 8 DOF as 4 sets of 2 DOF. 2) A model-based (MB) controller that uses the constant curvature model to control all 8 DOF. In simulations, the MB controller had a 92.6% p=0.000 loss reduction compared to the PID controller when positioning the robot in a desired location. Physical robot experiments were performed whereby an obstacle was moved towards the robot to measure the robot's deflection. 
If this obstacle was visible only to the fourth segment from the base, then the the MB controller was able to avoid the obstacle for a 92.9% p=1.010^-10 longer distance than the PID controller. If the obstacle was visible to both the fourth and third segment, the MB controller outperformed the PID controller by 65.5% p=1.810^-5. If the obstacle was visible only to the third segment, the MB controller is outperformed by the PID controller by 23.5% p=1.9*10^-6. Overall, the robot and the MB controller demonstrated effective obstacle avoidance and adaptability within constrained environments.

106219,Exposing Potential Origin Networks of Malicious Spoofed Traffic through Anycast Catchment Mapping,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106219,"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks prevent users from accessing a service by flooding it with excessive, unsolicited traffic. A popular form is the Reflection & Amplification (R&A) attack. These take advantage of legitimate services by reflecting and amplifying their responses to victims. IP spoofing is integral to these attacks, as attackers change their source address to that of the victim, thereby masking their own. This makes retribution against these attackers very challenging. A relatively unexplored approach for exposing information about malicious spoofed traffic is to leverage the unique properties of anycast routing. Under anycast, multiple sites are configured so that clients are automatically connected to the site topologically closest to them. This means that if spoofed traffic arrives at a certain anycast site, the spoofer must be located near that site, regardless of what source address it uses. It is possible to analyze the catchment of networks that an anycast site serves using the Verfploeter technique, a method that relies on active IPv4 wide probing. For this study, we lure spoofed DDoS traffic to the Tangled anycast testbed, consisting of 32 widespread nodes. This is done by deploying the AmpPot honeypot at every location. With this setup, we can create a list of prospect origin networks where a spoofer potentially resides by filtering out networks from catchment measurements. This is done based on the assumed hop count from the spoofer. We validated this method with ground truth data provided by CAIDA’s Spoofer project. Based on our test subjects, we can narrow down a spoofer’s network by systematically  eliminating up to 98% of known autonomous systems and routed prefixes. This sets the stage to determine more precisely where spoofed DDoS attacks originate, which can greatly help in retribution against attackers.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Palinckx, Bas",January 2025,English,"No.

This work presents a prototype 12x multiplexed microfluidic device designed for individual nanopore recordings and a proof of concept for frequency multiplexing of Bilayer Lipid Membranes (BLMs). Channels were fabricated by milling a PMMA substrate, achieving a width and height of 1 mm. A Teflon film, punctured with a 300-micron needle, served as the foundation for BLM formation. BLMs were formed by applying n-Hexadecane and DPhPC lipids onto the aperture and flowing buffer back and forth to induce a shear-thinning effect. By incorporating resistors at channel junctions, individual nanopore measurements remain stable even if neighboring BLMs rupture. Device validation was demonstrated using substrate binding domain 2 (SBD2) measurements in a type I cytolysin A (ClyA) nanopore, where both open configurations of SBD2 were distinguished via patch-clamp. Frequency multiplexing was explored to enable the formation of more than two BLMs per channel without introducing sneak paths.

106215,"De toekomst van AI in de zorg : Gebruik in verleden, heden en toekomst",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106215,"Abstract
Achtergrond: De implementatie van artificiële intelligentie (AI) in de gezondheidszorg heeft
het potentieel om diagnostische processen te ondersteunen en te verbeteren. Dit onderzoek
richt zich op het AI-systeem Alice, dat wordt ingezet voor de EEG-analyse bij epilepsie. De
interpretatie van EEG’s vereist efficiëntie en nauwkeurige analyse; AI-technologie kan hierin
een waardevolle ondersteuning bieden voor clinici. In dit onderzoek wordt specifiek
onderzocht wat de rol is van de perceptie van de zorgprofessional bij de acceptatie en gebruik
van AI.
Doel: Dit onderzoek richt zich op de invloed van de individuele perceptie van
zorgprofessionals op het gebruik van een AI-systeem bekent als een Intelligent Clincical
Decision Support System (ICDSS). Het zoomt in op de verandering van de perceptie over tijd.
Dit proces wordt onderzocht aan de hand van de Theory of Affordances om beter te begrijpen
wat gebruikers ervaren als mogelijkheden en beperkingen van een AI-systeem.
Methode: Het betreft een kwalitatief onderzoek dat gebruikmaakt van zes individuele,
semigestructureerde interviews met zorgprofessionals op de afdeling van de Neurologie van
een topklinisch ziekenhuis in Nederland. De interviews zijn getranscribeerd en geanalyseerd
door middel van open, axiale en selectieve codering. Bij deze methode worden eerst
afzonderlijke uitspraken gecodeerd, waarna verbanden tussen de codes worden gelegd om
bredere thema’s te identificeren.
Resultaten: De perceptie van zorgprofessionals – waaronder neurologen, technisch
laboranten en een technisch geneeskundige – ten aanzien van het gebruik van AI wordt sterk
beïnvloed door hun ervaring met het systeem. AI wordt vaak gezien als een ondersteunend
hulpmiddel dat bijdraagt aan een efficiëntere interpretatie van EEG-data. Zorgprofessionals
beschouwen dit als affordances: mogelijkheden die het systeem biedt om hun werk te
vergemakkelijken. Tegelijkertijd ervaren zij ook constraints: beperkingen die voortkomen uit
het gebruik van het systeem. Naarmate het AI-systeem zich verder ontwikkelt en
zorgprofessionals er meer ervaring mee opdoen, verandert ook hun perceptie van de
technologie wat kan leiden tot het ontstaan nieuwe affordances en constraints.
Conclusie: De acceptatie en het gebruik van AI bij de EEG-analyse van epilepsie worden
beïnvloed door de individuele percepties van zorgprofessionals. Deze percepties hangen
samen met de affordances en constraints die zij ervaren bij het gebruik van het AI-systeem.

106214,The Influence of Institutional Investors on ESG Decision Making within Insurance Companies : A Qualitative Analysis of Sustainable Investment Policy,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106214,"This thesis examines the pressure from institutional investors on the integration of ESG criteria into insurers' investment policies. Sustainable investment is gaining more attention in the financial sector, with insurers facing the challenge of incorporating non-financial aspects, such as environment and society, into their decision-making processes in addition to financial risks. The study focuses on whether and how external pressure from these investors leads to adjustments in insurance companies' ESG strategies. In this study, a qualitative research method was chosen, involving semi-structured interviews with investment policy representatives of three insurers. Relevant policy documents were also analysed. This triangulation provides valuable insights into both internal decision-making processes and the role of external influences, such as the implementation of new regulations like the CSRD and SFDR and social pressure. This study concludes that insurers perceive no significant pressure from institutional investors when it comes to integrating ESG criteria into investment strategies. Insurers are mainly internally driven to make their investments more sustainable. This is done through industry-wide agreements, such as the IMVO covenant and climate commitments, and the need to comply with stricter regulations, such as the CSRD and SFDR.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Veld, R.N. van 't",April 2025,English,"No

106213,Experiences and Support Needs of Young Adults Who Experienced Parental Alienation  in Childhood,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106213,"Background: Parental alienation (PA) is the phenomenon where a child loses contact 
with one or both parents in the context of/after a divorce, with some permanency. While PA 
usually is reversible, restoration of contact often takes many years, while usually the relation 
remains vulnerable and some extent damaged. Also it is argues that the underlying 
psychological processes damage the potential for future family relations of the child.
This thesis was carried out because of the limited data on the experiences and insight 
on solutions to prevent PA, as seen through the eyes of the children. Special permission was 
granted to approach young adults engaged recently in complex divorces. Despite children 
aged 12 and above in the Netherlands being invited to speak with a judge, there is little to no 
research that makes a distinction between the needs of those who are older and younger than 
12. Thus, this thesis additionally explored the differences between the two age groups. 
Aim: This thesis aims to examine the experiences and support needs of adults who 
experienced PA with a parent during their childhood. 
Methods: A qualitative study took place with two data-collection methods: 1)
Analysing open-ended questions of digital questionnaire completed by adults who were 
children when the PA took place (n=30), and 2) Focus group consultation with a subset of the
questionnaire respondents (n=5). A thematic analysis was carried out, following the six phases 
of the inductive thematic analysis guidelines provided by Braun & Clarke (2006).
Results: Experiences: foremost, all participants experienced negative consequences, 
of which the most mentioned was negative self-development. Even though positive 
consequences, like positive self-development, were also expressed, they took place out of 
necessity. Support needs: participants mostly referred to needing child-centred support from 
essentially all sources. An intense feeling of being left alone when support and understanding 
is most needed. Here, child-centred support means reaching out to them, to ask them their 
(second) opinion, and to check how they would deal with situations they face and contrasting 
expectations of their parents. Suggested solutions: participants suggested a trustee (buddy)
being available prior or during PA, someone they could unconditionally trust. Furthermore, 
this study observed that less children alienated above age 12 experienced difficulties in 
romantic relationships and family formation, compared to those alienated before age 12.
Conclusion: This thesis showed a need for change in current practises. PA-experienced adults expressed a need for child-centred personal support at the time they were a 
kid, possibly through a trustee standing up. A pilot research is recommended to test the 
effectiveness of such a trustee.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Öztürk, S.A.",April 2025,English,"No.

106211,Safety Education in the AI Era,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106211,"Safety standards are vital for building a safe and reliable society, yet their integration into European education remains limited. One challenge is that these standards are difficult for diverse student groups to access and understand due to differences in literacy, background, and expertise. Existing educational tools—like e-learning and gamification—lack the personalization needed for effective learning. To address this gap, a customized GPT-based system called SIAI (Safety Instructor AI) was developed to help students engage with safety standards more effectively through tailored textual and visual support. SIAI was tested in three phases. The first confirmed its ability to deliver accurate, domain-specific responses aligned with the NEN NTA 8287:2021 standard. The second test showed that visual elements and hierarchical structures significantly improved comprehension and engagement. The third test compared SIAI with traditional resources, showing that students using SIAI performed better in finding, understanding, and applying standard content. These results suggest that generative AI, when customized, can improve how safety standards are taught and learned. Further large-scale studies are recommended to confirm these promising outcomes.",Master Industrial Design Engineering (M-IDE),"Nguyen, Anh Tuan",April 2025,English,"No

106206,Super VJ Pro : Teaching VJing Through Gamified Hardware Interaction,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106206,"This research presents the development and evaluation of Super VJ Pro, an educational game designed to teach aspiring Visual Jockeys (VJs) the fundamentals of Visual Jockeying (VJing) through a gamified, interactive learning experience. Unlike traditional methods such as YouTube tutorials and software manuals, which often rely on passive learning, Super VJ Pro adopts a performance-first approach, emphasizing hands-on practice and real-time feedback. The game leverages a custom MIDI controller, BitchBoy, to provide an intuitive, tactile interface for users to practice and master essential VJing techniques. By integrating rhythm-based challenges, structured tutorials, and a minimalistic user interface, Super VJ Pro reduces cognitive load while fostering creativity and experimentation. The research addresses a significant gap in VJ education, as existing tools like Resolume Arena and MIDI controllers are primarily designed for professionals, lacking structured educational features for beginners. Super VJ Pro bridges this gap by offering a step-by-step progression system that guides users through core tasks such as clip launching, effect triggering, and beat synchronization. The game’s design is informed by cognitive load theory and gamification principles, ensuring learning is both accessible and engaging. Through iterative development and user testing, Super VJ Pro was refined to provide clear feedback, gradual skill progression, and a seamless transition to professional VJ software. Testing with beginner VJs demonstrated the effectiveness of the performance-first approach, with participants successfully applying learned skills in Resolume Arena. The findings highlight how gamified tools can lower barriers to complex creative domains by prioritizing active experimentation over passive instruction. This thesis contributes an evaluated prototype and framework for gamified learning in performative skills, demonstrating the potential of performance-first, hardware-integrated tools to make creative education more accessible. Future work could expand the game’s features, deepen integration with professional software, and adapt its design principles to other domains requiring real-time skill application.",Master Interaction Technology (M-ITECH),"Constantinou, Christos",April 2025,English,"No.

106205,Development of a protocol for the imaging and diameter analysis of the common femoral vein in a tiltable MRI,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106205,"Diameter measurements of (the iliofemoral) veins are sensitive to cross-sectional crush1and body position2. The diameter of a vein is of importance for the placement of venous
stents in the treatment of iliofemoral Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). This research therefore
investigated the development of an image acquisition protocol in a tiltable MRI to image
the left common femoral vein (LCFV) in upright, supine, and hip flexion positions and a
method for subsequent diameter analysis of the LCFV in these positions.
Multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences were experimented with, with the
sequences with the best initial results further optimized by variation of MRI parameters.
For diameter analysis, the Maximum-Inscribed-Sphere (MIS) and Circular-Equivalent (CE)
diameter offered by ’3D Slicer’ could be used.
The resulting image acquisition protocol comprises a T2 Fast Spin Echo (FSE) sequence for
a good overview of pelvic anatomy and a Time-Of-Flight (TOF) sequence for the subsequent
analysis of the diameter of the LCFV.
When comparing the LCFV in upright and supine positions, the acquired MRI images show
that the LCFV has become twice as large. The CE diameter (upright) has increased to a
range of approximately 9.2 - 15.2 mm and the MIS diameter to a range of approximately
7.6 - 12.0 mm compared to a range of 3.0 - 10.8 mm (CE, supine) and 2.5 - 8.8 mm (MIS,
supine).
When comparing the LCFV in hip-flexion and supine positions, the acquired MRI images
show that the LCFV has become 1,5 times larger. The CE diameter has grown to a range
of approximately 7.5 - 13.2 mm (hip-flexion) and the MIS diameter to a range of 5.8 - 9.5
mm compared to the above mentioned ranges for the supine position.
The image quality from the upright scan implicated the diameter measurements in ’3D
Slicer’ as the threshold value could not be set such that only the vein would be selected. It
is suggested to investigate a way to reduce motion from the participant in upright position.
Furthermore, flow-related ghosting artefacts presented with the TOF sequence and may also
affect the diameter measurements. The Circular-Equivalent (CE) diameter is recommended
for diameter measurement with the goal of stent placement.",Bachelor Biomedical Engineering (B-BMT),"Cordes, L.J.C.",April 2025,English,"No

106204,Wie Wilt Weer Noar Huus : A study into improving crowd management at Enschede Kennispark,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106204,"In the east of the Netherlands, a small train station is located adjacent to a large football stadium. This 
station, Enschede Kennispark, is not designed to accommodate the large influx of train travellers 
following matches at the stadium. Crowd management measures are essential to ensure smooth 
operations, yet a disproportionately high number of stewards is required due to the misbehaviours that 
frequently arise during the outflow phase. Recognising these challenges, the social security manager 
of NS seeks to improve the situation at Enschede Kennispark.
The problem analysis identifies several challenges at the station after matches at the Grolsch Veste, 
with the most significant issues affecting travellers heading toward Hengelo. Consequently, this study 
focuses primarily on this flow. A mismatch between the safe platform capacity and train capacity results 
in waiting times of up to 30 minutes. Additionally, there are limited means to inform travellers about 
train delays or schedule changes. It is hypothesized that longer waiting times lead to an increase in 
misbehaviour. The objective is to reduce waiting times; however, this is complicated by varying match 
characteristics and end times, which affect the effectiveness of different measures. Furthermore, 
multiple stakeholders, each with their own responsibilities and objectives, may have conflicting 
interests, adding to the challenge.
A literature review provides insights into the effects and perception of waiting times. Waiting is 
generally perceived as a negative experience, with perception largely influenced by the availability and 
quality of information. Research indicates that standstill waiting times should be minimised, 
particularly those exceeding eight minutes, as they can significantly impact individuals' moods. Based 
on these insights, this thesis aims to “reduce misbehaviours at Enschede Kennispark after football 
matches in the Grolsch Veste by providing recommendations to the social security manager of NS in 
order to decrease the actual and perceived waiting times.”
To develop effective measures for reducing waiting times, this study applies the framework ‘selecting
and assessing effective crowd management measures’ (Mensink, 2017). A microscopic pedestrian 
simulation model is used to accurately quantify the effects of various measures and to evaluate 
multiple interventions across different scenarios. The scenarios that are considered are 1) a regular FC 
Twente match on Sunday afternoon, 2) a match with a late ending when fewer trains are available, and 
3) an FC Twente match with an increased number of visitors. The measures which are analysed are 1) 
a readjustment of the train stop position on the platform to better match the influx on the platform 
and increase the safe waiting capacity, 2) an expansion of the platform such that the safe waiting 
capacity can be further increased, 3) an extra shuttle train to decrease the headways, and 4) an 
alteration of the turnstile program to reduce the standstill wait time. 
The impact of these measures is assessed based on key performance indicators, which follow out of 
the objectives of stakeholders, and include standstill waiting times, total pedestrian delays, walk-in and 
walk-out counts, average crowd density, and Level of Service. Among the proposed measures, 
introducing an extra train is the most effective at reducing standstill waiting times while maintaining a 
safe crowd density. This option is particularly beneficial in mitigating misalignment between match end 
times and train schedules. Platform expansion also significantly reduces standstill waiting times; 
however, it increases crowd densities on the platform to potentially dangerous levels. Readjusting the 
train stop position performs slightly worse than the other two measures, yet is still a large improvement 
to the baseline, and offers the advantage of being cost-effective. Lastly, the alternative turnstile 
programme alleviates queue densities at the turnstiles but results in slightly longer waiting times.
Future research could focus on intervention studies to assess the actual benefits of the measures, or 
on simulation of queues in the social forces model.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"Harmsen, H.Z.",March 2025,English,"Yes

106203,The role of GenAI in data analysis for Dutch SMEs,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106203,"In the continuously evolving data analysis environment, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) face many challenges. Alongside this, the rise of AI, specifically GenAI, can potentially drive significant changes in how business operates. The existing literature lacks a comprehensive overview of the use of data analysis and the role of GenAI within SMEs, which this article addresses and provides a model that illustrates how GenAI could be used within companies possessing distinct phases of data analysis. The results show most of the companies are between diagnostic and predictive analysis. Most of the SMEs have time, knowledge and/or capacity constraints to progress further, something that GenAI and consultancy can both support, although GenAI will reduce the need for consultancy. GenAI is a promising technology and proposes interesting cases like coding assistance, and as a creative assistant, which could partially allocate time, capacity and knowledge constraints. Where companies in the beginning phase of data analysis could mainly resist on coding and GenAI as a creative assistance, further on integration into systems and the use for efficiency purposes becomes more crucial. However, companies need to use GenAI, they need to be cautious and don’t rely blindly on the output GenAI provides.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Lenting, Thijs J.",April 2025,English,"No

In this research, the materials LMPAEK and carbon fiber LMPAEK composite (C/LMPAEK) were brought to above melting temperature in a rheometer and were subjected to indentation tests at different constant indentation velocities. The LMPAEK material was indented with an axisymmetric spherical indenter and the measured normal forces over indentation depth were compared to conventional viscosity test methods, a closed form solution, and finite element method simulations. The C/LMPAEK material was indented with a cylindrical indenter in the fiber direction to isolate the transverse flow behavior from the longitudinal flow behavior. A plane strain Kelvin model simulation was fitted to the measured indentation force over indentation depth to see if it was possible to characterize the flow behavior of the transverse viscosity of C/LMPAEK in melt. It was found that the LMPAEK indentation tests could not accurately describe material behavior, due to rheometer not being as accurate in its measurements as needed.

It has been applied in different fields, such as robotics and healthcare. Using inertial motion capture (IMC) systems enables researchers to derive lower-body kinematics, such as orientation, acceleration, angular velocity and position of each segment. Commercial IMC systems generally use one sensor on each body segment.  Yet, for monitoring daily living tasks, this is too extensive and expensive due to the number of sensors used. The use of fewer IMUs than one sensor per segment could result in a cheaper and more appropriate solution. This thesis aimed at estimating the lower-body kinematics based on the information provided by three IMUs. These IMUs were positioned on each foot and one on the back near the pelvis. Based on the acceleration and orientation information from the IMUs, a forward kinematics chain-based constrained Kalman filter was used to estimate lower-body kinematics during walking. Using walking tasks data from an online dataset, the mean joint position RMSE and segment orientation RMSE across all tasks and subjects were 6.2 ± 3.6 cm and 11.5 ± 5.9°, respectively, indicating a reasonable level of accuracy.",Master Biomedical Engineering (M-BME),"Pol, E. van den",April 2025,English,"No

106199,3d morphometric analysis of wrist bone anatomy,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106199,"The focus of the thesis is to extract and analyze the 3D wrist bone shape to derive requirements for
the Total Wrist Replacement (TWR) implant. The major challenges in designing these implants have
been to account for the wide range of variation in wrist bones across the population. Designing a
patient-specific implant is time-consuming and a simple gender-based design is not sufficient. To
achieve successful implant function and longevity, it is important to understand these variations and
design implants that are tailored to them. To address the issue of patient-specific and simple sexbased implant design, this thesis performs hierarchical clustering to understand the natural
grouping in the population that can help in designing a wide range of implants.
This thesis uses the freely available Open-Source Carpal Database (OSCD). The features of the
carpal bones, radius, ulna, and metacarpals were extracted using the Python scripting language and
its libraries. The carpal surfaces were segmented using 2 approaches, vertex-normal and proximitybased, and Amberg's optimal step non-rigid iterative closest point (ANRICP) algorithm. The OSCD
dataset was pre-processed to align with the anatomical coordinate system (ACS).
The carpal bone parameters showed a significant sexual dimorphism using independent t-test or
Mann-Whitney U test (p<0,05). Males were generally larger than females with respect to carpal bone
parameters. The segmented articular surfaces were significantly different when obtained by the 2
methods using paired Student t-test (p<0,05). Although the length, width, and surface area of the
males were greater than those of the females with respect to the articular surfaces, the curvature
values for the females were greater than those of the males, which could be the result of bone size.
When it comes to reaming parameters, it was observed that women had a higher radial inclination
(mean difference 0.29), carpal ratio (mean difference 0.07) and the curvature of proximal-PCR
articular surface (mean difference 0.06) than men.
Clustering produced 15 groups when the features were selected based on their importance value.
14 groups were formed when only the PCR features and radial features were considered in the
clustering based on ulnar variance (0-negative, 1-positive) and 11 groups were formed when the
clustering was performed based on gender (0-female, 1-male). These results can be used to develop
a series of designs for the implant.",Master Biomedical Engineering (M-BME),"Sainath, Shreyas Vadhula",March 2025,English,"No

Because these communication methods are largely visual, the auditory domain, such as music, is predominantly a reactive element of game design. The aim of this thesis is to investigate how music affects the players navigational behaviour by creating a maze based video game where the effect of directional guiding music is analyzed. The research was evaluated by conducting a qualitative data analysis on ten university students who played through the game which involved two mazes. One maze had a more clear main path for the player to follow, where the music attempted to lure them towards side paths, and the other a more traditional maze where the music guided them down the correct path. The participants were divided into two groups of five, where one had guiding music enabled, while the other did not.

106196,Textual Complexity in Dutch Physics Secondary Education Textbooks from 1965 to 2024,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106196,"Reading comprehension is an essential skill for functioning in society. However, the reading comprehension levels in the Netherlands are declining and therefore attention is given to reading comprehension instruction and education. One possible intervention is text simplification, which is often used in the context of second-language learning. However, research on the effectiveness of text simplification in education shows contradicting results and warnings are issued against over-simplification of texts, by comparing older and recent materials intuitively. Those claims are yet to be substantiated by systematic research. Therefore, this study explored the changes of textual complexity over time while controlling for the educational level, grade level and topic. This was done by investigating fragments from 39 educational textbooks. The quantification of text characteristics was performed by T-Scan, a software for Dutch textual analysis. Significant changes were found for four out of nineteen textual parameters. The findings indicate slightly less complex texts over time, especially in the sentence length and number of partial sentences. This study is the first step in bridging the gap between intuitive observations and structural textual complexity research, and hopefully influences the discussions about simplification of educational texts over time.",Master Educational Science and Technology (M-EST),"Schmidt, Jennifer",April 2025,English,"No

While previous quantitative research has demonstrated the therapy ́s effectiveness in reducing anxiety and depression, little is known about how clients themselves experience it, particularly in group therapy settings. The present study explored how clients who participated in Acceptance and Commitment group therapy describe their experiences. It offers a deeper understanding of the therapeutic processes and perceived outcomes of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in a group. A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted on questionnaire responses from 68 participants who participated in Acceptance and Commitment group therapy at the mental health organisation “Mindfit”. The questionnaire data was analysed inductively, identifying underlying themes in how clients described their experiences. The analysis revealed five central themes: Safety and Trust in Group Therapy, Learning to Accept Thoughts and Emotions, Feeling more Alive and Engaged, Taking it Beyond the Group Therapy, and Opportunities for Improvement. The findings indicate that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ́s processes are experienced in varied personal ways, often beyond symptom reduction. Clients naturally integrate the therapy ́s processes into their lives, even without explicitly using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy terminology when describing their experiences.

Consequently, this study aimed to enhance the existing literature concerning identity work and AI by demonstrating how interactions between doctors and AI contribute to the process of identity formation. An inductive semi-structured qualitative study involving fourteen participants was conducted, and the data was analysed using a combination of Braun’s Thematic Analysis and the Gioia method. The findings indicated that, likely due to the strong professional identities of the doctors, they perceived AI as a means of identity enhancement rather than as a source of identity threat. Furthermore, medical practitioners regarded AI as a tool or assistant rather than a colleague, and their receptive attitudes were evident in how they emphasised its advantages. Additionally, perceptions of AI have shifted over time; considering the continuous learning and development that doctors experience throughout their careers, the integration of AI has been shown to perpetuate an ongoing process of identity work and adaptation, potentially leading to changes in their professional identities.

It affects student performance, incurs organisational costs, and disrupts school culture. Although teacher absenteeism has been widely studied internationally, little is known about its antecedents within the Dutch context, and predictive models tailored to this setting are lacking despite growing practical demand. This study addresses these gaps by identifying key antecedents of teacher absenteeism and applying machine learning (ML) models to predict absence duration categories (short-, medium-, and long-term). A multi-method sequential design was adopted across three studies. Study 1 involved eight qualitative interviews with education professionals to identify context-specific antecedents. Study 2 used regression analyses (OLS and Poisson) on HR data from 1,150 teachers (2023–2024) to assess the relationship between various antecedents and absenteeism, measured by duration and frequency. Study 3 applied Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine models to predict absence duration. Key antecedents include gender, prior absenteeism, tenure, working hours, team-level absenteeism, and employment status, while school type and team FTE emerged as novel factors. The Naïve Bayes model achieved 90.7% accuracy and a 0.94 F1-score. This study enhances our understanding of teacher absenteeism and addresses the practical need for predictive analytics in educational context.

Each subcategory is showcased by a row of images depicting progressive stages of quality; the feeling of improvement throughout the row enables the user to compare their work to the images and therefore pinpoint the level of quality they are currently at. 
A pilot test was conducted with students who had finished a beginner-level course in 3D modelling. The participants were tasked with finding as many errors in a test model implementing a prototype of the digital guide. All users were able to understand the guide’s image-based system, and the guide received a score of 9.2 out of 10.
A key takeaway from the pilot testing was how categorisation created a feeling of safety for most participants.

Many state-of-the-art detection systems only determine malicious behavior by looking at the malware sample. Not looking at the target process of code injection means they miss part of the malicious behavior. No research studies the effects of code injection on benign injected processes, so it is unclear how much malicious process behavior (e.g., system calls) modern solutions miss. We propose a framework that automatically identifies behavior exhibited by injecting malware samples and their victim processes after being targeted by code injection. The framework utilizes dynamic analysis to find the system calls of the malware sample and its victim and matches the found system calls to SIGMA rules that define behavior. We then use this framework to gather the behaviors of 436 real-life samples and their victims to approximate the behavior missed in modern detection systems. Our experiments suggest that solutions miss, on average, 56.3% of behavior when looking strictly at the amount of tracked system calls and 64% of behavior when looking at the amount of SIGMA rules found.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Bals, Jordi",April 2025,English,"No.

106160,Assessing Single and Dual Sensor IMU Setup for 3D Foot Modelling in Running,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106160,"Background: Accurate foot kinematics are essential for gait analysis, injury prevention, and performance assessment. Optical motion capture (OMC) is the gold standard for multi-segment foot modelling, but inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a portable, low-cost alternative. Most IMU-based approaches use a single foot-mounted sensor, treating the foot as a rigid segment.
Objective: This study compares the accuracy of single- and dual-IMU setups for estimating hindfoot–forefoot (HF/FF) joint angles during running, using OMC as a reference. It also evaluates the influence of running speed and foot strike pattern (forefoot strikerFFSvs. rearfoot strikerRFS).
Methods: Six recreational runners (3 FFS, 3 RFS) ran at 9 and 11 kph on an instrumented treadmill. IMUs and OMC recorded foot segment orientations. The dual-IMU setup measured hindfoot and forefoot orientations directly, while the single-IMU setup estimated forefoot orientation. Joint angles were compared to OMC using RMSE, standard deviation (SD), and correlation.
Results: Both setups showed similar error patterns, with the largest differences at toe-off. The dual-IMU setup improved accuracy during push-off, but had higher variability. Speed increased error; strike pattern had minimal effect. Single-IMU setups may suffice for general gait analysis, while dual-IMU setups are preferable for applications requiring detailed forefoot tracking. The choice between setups should therefore be made based on the specific goals of the analysis.",Master Biomedical Engineering (M-BME),"Ghiani, Miriam",April 2025,English,"No

These cores are employed in several areas, including environments with a higher risk of hardware errors, such as space. Critical systems must be able to detect and resolve as many errors as possible to maintain reliable operation. Error detection, logging, analysis and resolution keep systems operational while collecting important diagnostic information. The RISC-V organisation proposed a specification for formatting error information, known as RERI. However, extensive and large nature of this format can be impractical where time and resources are scarce. Furthermore, no dedicated framework around this error logging format has been specified yet. This work builds on the initial RISC-V RERI specification by implementing an adapted version called ”RERI-Lite”. Developed primarily for research use in radiation beam experiments, this system addresses the needs of smaller scale applications with high error rates. This thesis focuses on the implementation of a RERI-Lite based system and it compares RERI-Lite to the standard RERI format. It demonstrates how the lighter, more flexible design of RERI-Lite improves performance in resource-constrained contexts.

106153,Perceived autonomy in the age of personalized search : Evaluating the impact of the GDPR in search engines,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106153,"In an era where personalized algorithms shape online information access, safeguarding user autonomy has become increasingly vital. This study explores whether the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is associated with higher levels of perceived autonomy in the context of search engines. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), autonomy is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct comprising personalization control, algorithmic transparency, and search result diversity. A quantitative survey (N = 349) among Dutch users revealed that while the GDPR is associated with greater perceived diversity in search results, its perceived impact on transparency and control is limited. Digital skills emerged as the strongest predictor of autonomy: individuals with higher digital literacy felt more capable of managing privacy settings and understanding algorithmic processes. A comparison between general and GDPR-specific perceptions showed that users attribute improved diversity to GDPR, but not improved control or transparency. This study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of digital autonomy by bridging psychological and regulatory perspectives. It highlights that legal frameworks like the GDPR, though essential, are not sufficient on their own. Real user empowerment depends on individuals’ ability to understand and act upon their digital rights. To close the gap between legal protection and lived experience, clearer regulatory communication and targeted public education are needed.

106149,Improved Low-contrast Spaghetti Defect Detection for FDM Printers,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106149,"Spaghetti defects are a common failure in FDM printing, often caused by object detachment from the print bed or missing supports, leading to filament being extruded in the air, These defects mostly cause unrecoverable errors, resulting in wasted time and materials. While computer vision-based anomaly detection methods exist, they lack robustness for low-contrast environments, for example, when using black filament against a dark background. This work explores whether a Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) algorithm can improve anomaly detection in such conditions. A novel LLIE approach, CoLIE, is combined with a YOLO11 object detection model to perform anomaly detection, which is evaluated on a Colour, Black and external test dataset. The results are then compared to Obico, an open-source YOLOv2-based spaghetti detection model. To further analyze the practical performance, a new metric is introduced, the Print Failure Stopping Metric (PFSM), which highlights the performance per print. Results show that CoLIE does not consistently improve the detection performance and even reduces it in some cases. However, YOLO11 shows a significant improvement over Obico, even achieving a 17.5% higher F1-score on the external test dataset, indicating good generalizability.",Master Computer Science (M-CS),"Leenheer, Bart",April 2025,English,"No

106147,The Role of Acute Dynamic Risk Factors in Forensic Treatment,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106147,"Risk factors are central aspects of forensic treatment, as they represent contextual, behavioural and psychological characteristics of offenders that influence recidivism risk.
Static and stable dynamic risk factors (SDRFs) are well-established and widely used in forensic practice to predict long-term recidivism risk. However, the role of acute dynamic risk factors (ADRFs), which fluctuate rapidly and are useful for short-term risk prediction, is underexplored. This study examines the contemporary role of ADRFs in forensic treatment, by analysing semi-structured interviews with 27 forensic therapists and researchers. By
applying thematic analysis, this study explores how ADRFs are addressed across four
treatment phases; diagnostics, risk assessment, therapy, and rehabilitation. Findings indicate that ADRFs are considered along the four phases of treatment, however by a minority of
participants. ADRFs seem to be more prominent during treatment and rehabilitation, while their role in diagnostics and risk assessment appears comparatively lower. Risk assessment tools predominantly focus on static and SDRFs, with ADRF-specific instruments being used by a minority of participants. Based on the results, practical constraints, such as frequent assessment and resource limitations, seem to influence the limited use of acute-specific instruments. Moreover, addressing ADRFs in forensic treatment appears to be challenging due to their quickly fluctuating nature, suggesting the need for continued improvement in treatment approaches. For future research, it is interesting to explore more efficient assessment and management techniques to facilitate the integration of ADRFs into forensic treatment.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Pietsch, Samuel",April 2025,English,"No.

Therefore, this study investigated the effects of different moderating variables on the effectiveness of adaptive guidance in a simulation-based inquiry learning environment. A total of 72 fifth- and sixth-grade students participated in a pre-test/post-test design, with one condition receiving adaptive guidance and the other receiving no guidance. While both conditions showed significant improvement in absolute scores on the post-test, resulting in a positive normalized knowledge gain, no significant difference was found between the two conditions. Further analysis explored the role of prior knowledge, ability level, and self-regulated learning skills as potential moderators, but no significant effects were found. These findings suggest that adaptive guidance, as implemented in this study, may not be a decisive factor in improving learning outcomes and highlight the need for further research on which factors influence the effectiveness of adaptive guidance.",Master Educational Science and Technology (M-EST),"Maurik, Louis van",April 2025,English,"No

This scoping review examines MRTs on mobile mental health interventions, highlighting common practices and emerging developments to inform future research. A systematic search was conducted across Web of Science, PsycINFO, PubMed, and ClinicalTrial.gov. Data on study and sample characteristics, MRT design choices, and study outcomes were extracted and summarised. The literature search identified 13 studies targeting diverse populations and mental health outcomes. Most studies randomised interventions at daily decision points using equal probabilities, with observations of context collected for exploratory moderation analyses. Some studies additionally used observations of context to personalise intervention content, assess participant availability for randomisation, or align intervention options with individual needs. Study outcomes showed immediate intervention effects that varied depending on contextual factors. Concludingly, MRTs have been applied to a range of early-stage mobile mental health interventions, primarily for exploratory purposes to map out effective intervention strategies.

This can be done using passive mechanical elements. This study reveals a novel leaf spring-based negative stiffness mechanism designed for high vibration isolation bandwidth purposes along a single axis. The design is based on specific requirements, primarily achieving a target negative stiffness while ensuring minimum variation in stiffness for a given operation range. Additionally, it must maintain low dynamic stiffness from saturation point, across all operating range for mechanism up to required isolation range. Geometrical properties of leaf springs with relevant boundary conditions are achieved by solving an optimization problem. The mechanism is designed, manufactured and tested to investigate its performance. To assess static performance of the mechanism, static stiffness test is carried for total operation range of the mechanism. The test reveals required nominal stiffness and
variation in static stiffness. For dynamic performance, dynamic stiffness test is carried out up to a certain frequency. Dynamic stiffness test reveals internal dynamic performance of the mechanism and their effect on isolation performance for different operating positions. The proposed negative stiffness mechanism proves the feasibility of passive isolation devices that require high internal modes with low static stiffness.",Master Mechanical Engineering (M-ME),"Asma, Batuhan",April 2025,English,"No.

This technology has shown to improve collaboration, design understanding, and decision-making. So far, large enterprises have more widely adopted VR, while SMEs still struggle to do so. 
This thesis therefore explores how VR can be made more accessible to SMEs in the engineering design industry. Using a research-through-design (RtD) approach, a case study was conducted at an SME to explore the development and adoption of an iteratively designed VR solution. This process revealed key barriers and enablers associated with VR adoption in SMEs. Findings led to the development of an extended TOE framework, introducing a Strategy dimension that focuses on factors that contribute to lowering  the barriers of SME-specific constraints. The extended framework serves as the foundation of the VR adoption roadmap, which provides a structured approach towards the steps an SME can take to adopt a suitable VR solution.

However, individuals with autism spectrum disorder and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (referred to as AuDHD) may experience differences in memory recall and rapport-building behaviours, which misalign with normative expectations. Additionally, their nonverbal traits are often misinterpreted as deceiving, increasing risks like false confessions. Using a virtual mock-burglary scenario, this study examines how suspect status (guilty vs. innocent), self-reported rapport and cognitive load influenced nonverbal behaviour. A moderated mediation model tested whether rapport mediated the relationship between neurodiversity status and nonverbal behaviour and whether cognitive load moderated these effects. While no differences in nonverbal behaviour frequency were found, AuDHD participants exhibited longer durations of nonverbal behaviour. This lack of difference may be attributed to high rapport scores across the groups, as higher rapport associates with increased nonverbal behaviour. However, rapport mediated this effect for AuDHD participants but only with low cognitive load, suggesting that AuDHD individuals differs in response rapport. Cognitive load did not moderate these effects. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing AuDHD individuals’ unique nonverbal traits during investigative interview settings.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Bouma, D.",April 2025,English,"No.

The study also sought to build a Planning Support System (PSS) prototype to help prioritize Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) development along the BRT Corridors proposed by the city. Primary data were collected via Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) with stakeholders, while secondary data were used to compute Potential TOD indicators such as population density, commercial density, employment density, business density, land use diversity, land use mix, intersection density, and the total length of roads suitable for walking and cycling. These indicators underwent Spatial Multicriteria Analysis (SMCA) to create a TOD Index.
The findings revealed a mean TOD Index of 0.28495 and a median of 0.29993 across approximately 8,459 grid cells of 300300m each in the city. High TOD index values (greater than 0.5) were found in the city centre, reflecting favourable conditions for TOD due to higher densities, better transit connectivity, and diverse land uses. Conversely, peri-urban and peripheral areas exhibited low TOD index values (ranging from 0 to 0.2) due to lower population densities, limited transit connectivity, and less diverse land use patterns. Spatial statistical analysis using Global Moran's I demonstrated significant positive spatial autocorrelation and clustering of high TOD index values. The Getis-Ord Gi and Anselin Local Moran's I statistics identified significant hotspots, particularly in central urban areas, indicating areas that would benefit most from transit connectivity improvements and TOD interventions.
To test the PSS Prototype, variables for population, commercial, employment, and business densities were used in CommunityViz to derive the TOD Index at each BRT Corridor. Two scenarios were set: the Base scenario considered the current situation, while the Increased Density scenario accounted for the city's dynamic changes. In the Base scenario, BRT Corridor 2 was the most favourable with a mean TOD Index of 0.21, while BRT Corridor 4 was the least favourable. In the Increased Density scenario, BRT Corridor 2 remained the most favourable, validating its potential for TOD implementation. The PSS prototype demonstrated potential for interactive analysis to prioritize BRT development, providing urban planners and policymakers with actionable insights.
This study concluded that TOD could effectively address urban mobility challenges. However, tailored strategies that consider local contexts and involve stakeholders are essential. Policy recommendations include expanding the PT network to connect the city centre with peripheral areas, encouraging mixed-use development to create vibrant, walkable neighbourhoods, redistributing services across the city, providing economic incentives for investment in peripheral areas, prioritizing affordable housing to prevent displacement, and enhancing capacity-building initiatives for planners. Continuous data integration and user feedback are crucial for refining the PSS tool.
Limitations to this study included the unavailability of socioeconomic data and a constrained timeframe. These limitations affected the in-depth exploration of the PSS prototype. Future research should focus on integrating more datasets to enhance the tool's functionality and relevance. This integration may provide a better representation of urban conditions, enabling more precise planning and policy decisions.

Notably, the question is asked about how individuals form affectionate relationships with AI. The focus is on Replika, a social chatbot (SC) that provides emotional support and companionship. Through a combination of technological, psychological, sociological and philosophical theories, this research explores different mechanisms which contribute to the emergence of emotional bonds with AI. Factors such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), tailored conversations and persuasive design endorse emotional bonds. Also, this research demonstrates that the companies behind AI companions influence individuals' experiences through corporate motives and marketing strategies. Considering that individuals describe Replika as a significant emotional friend, it raises concerns about corporate responsibility, dependence and emotional vulnerability. The latter is often used to commodify human feelings within surveillance capitalism. By conducting theories based on postphenomenology and critical theory, this research claims that human-AI relationships need to be studied beyond individual psychology, focusing on technological mediation and underlying power dynamics.

106122,To Label or Not to Label : The Impact of AI Disclosure on Credibility and Engagement on LinkedIn,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106122,"AI-generated content (AIGC) is becoming increasingly common across social media platforms, and AI disclosure labels are emerging as a key mechanism in transparency initiatives. Yet, user interactions with AI labels remain largely underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates how LinkedIn users respond to content labelled as AI-generated, examining effects on sender credibility and content engagement. Moreover, it accounts for differences in content modality (text vs. image), and sender type (individual vs. organization), as well as the underlying factors social presence and user attitudes towards AI in content creation. Through a 2×2×2 experimental design, N = 237 participants evaluated fictional LinkedIn posts varying in AI disclosure and sender identity. The sample had a mean age of M = 31.1 years (SD = 10) and consisted of 58.2% female, 40.9% male, 0.4% diverse, and 0.4% non-binary participants. The findings revealed that AI labels impact credibility and engagement on LinkedIn in nuanced ways. While AI text labels reduce both sender credibility and engagement, labelling images show no significant effects. Meanwhile, social presence plays a central mediating role in shaping responses to AI-labelled content, whereas user attitudes towards AI moderate label-induced effects. Overall, the study reveals a tension between the increasing popularity of AIGC and user expectations of LinkedIn content. While labelling visuals as AI-generated does not cause meaningful effects, disclosing the textual component of a LinkedIn post as AI-generated jeopardises credibility and engagement. Ultimately, these findings underscore the importance of authenticity and originality on LinkedIn and highlight the need for platforms and users to carefully consider how AI is being integrated into the present and future content landscape.",Master Communication Science (M-COM),"Schöning, Nils",April 2025,English,"No

106116,Practical Implementation of Self-Directed Learning: A Case Study,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106116,"The current public school system is still characterized by passive, teacher-centered education.
However, current research indicates that autonomy is a fundamental need for students and that student-centered approaches, such as Self-Directed Learning (SDL), lead to more active and meaningful learning
as well as higher academic achievement. While the literature shows these benefits of SDL, the implementation in an effective and scalable school system requires further research.
To understand how to apply SDL in a practical context, this study is one of the first to investigate
SDL as the foundation of a school’s pedagogical system through a case study. The Alemannen-School
was selected as it is very well recognized as a pioneer in German education, has received the German School Award, and has demonstrated higher academic achievement than other schools in BadenWürttemberg in the VERA comparison study.
The research employs a mixed-method case study design using a qualitative observation among
students between grades 5 and 10 to identify the SDL methods that are expected to contribute to academic achievement. A subsequent survey investigates quantitatively how the students use and perceive
the SDL elements, as well as how such elements impact their learning experience.
The study found that SDL methods, expected to contribute to academic achievement, were effectively integrated into the school’s pedagogical system, supporting self-management, self-monitoring,
and motivation at every step of the self-directed learning process. Among the most impactful methods
identified were goal-setting, self-paced learning, and the use of structured learning materials. The results
further revealed a correlation between students’ positive perception of SDL methods and their perceived
effectiveness.
The outcome of this study demonstrates the potential and feasibility of a well-structured SDL
approach to enhance students’ autonomy, engagement, and academic achievement in a scalable school

106112,Optimising Multi-Compartment Routing in Cross-Docking Networks : A Hybrid TS-SA Approach,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106112,"Efficient vehicle routing in cross-docking logistics is a complex challenge, particularly when managing temperature-controlled, multi-compartment vehicles with strict delivery constraints. This research addresses the Vehicle Routing Problem with Cross-Docking (VRPCD), extending it to incorporate multi-compartment vehicle constraints—including temperature compatibility—alongside strict time windows and cross-docking synchronisation. These aspects are not integrated in other applications of the VRPCD found in the literature, highlighting the novelty and relevance of this study. To solve this complex problem, a hybrid Tabu Search–Simulated Annealing (TS-SA) algorithm is developed. The algorithm combines the guidance of memory-based search inherent to TS with the probabilistic exploration advantages of SA. This combination allows the search process to escape local optima and find high-quality solutions across complex and constrained search spaces. The solution method is generalisable across supply chains where cross-docking is employed to collect, consolidate, and deliver goods using a fleet of homogeneous (multi-compartment) vehicles. A case study at Wolter Koops, a leading temperature-controlled logistics provider, demonstrates the practical effectiveness of the approach. Using a two-day dataset of 133 transport orders, the algorithm reduces total transportation costs by 31.8\%. It improves average vehicle load efficiency by 8.1\%, compared to the historical planning outcomes for the same two-day sample. Sensitivity analyses confirm the model’s robustness across varying cost structures, time window tightness, and travel speeds. This research contributes to practice and theory by addressing an underexplored variant of the VRPCD. However, the study is limited by its reliance on static routing assumptions, predefined cross-dock allocations, and validation on a two-day dataset.

This research is focused on the influence fuel type aggregation on the accuracy of wildfire simulations outcomes, by using the Flammap fire behaviour modelling software. The FBFM40 fuel type classification (Scott & Burgan, 2005) has been systematically aggregated based on the following fire behaviour characteristics: fuel load, rate of spread, and flame lengths or no specific characteristic. The River Road East Fire, 2023, in the Lolo National Forest, Montana (USA), has been selected as the study area. This due to its representative boreal forest ecosystem and recent fire occurrence. This study uses the Minimum Travel Time (MTT) fire spread model to analyse changes in simulation accuracy across multiple levels of fuel type aggregation. The Sørensen Similarity Index (SSI) has been used to quantify the under- and over-simulation, while entropy levels have been calculated to evaluate the fuel type diversity left within the input data. The results indicate that fuel type aggregation mainly impacts the over-simulation, especially after the 6 aggregation steps and or when the entropy levels reached < 0.61. The rate of spread showed the greatest influence on the simulation accuracy.
The findings suggest that maintaining an optimal level between the amount of unique fuel types left in the simulation and the fuel type diversity (entropy) is essential to balance the computational efficiency and simulation accuracy. This study shows potential risks of oversimplification for the input fuel type classification to use in fire behaviour modelling Future research should explore dynamic aggregation methods with more focus on small-scale differences as well as fire suppression efforts.

106109,Adaptive PPF Control Using a Modified EKF Observer,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106109,"This thesis presents an approach for suppressing parasitic vibrations in flexure-based structures with
varying resonance frequencies by integrating an indirect adaptive Positive Position Feedback controller
with an Extended Kalman Filter estimator. Flexure-based systems experience changes in resonance
frequency due to elasto-kinematic effects, which require real-time adaptation of the PPF controller
parameters to maintain optimal performance.
The focus of this study is on the low-frequency vibration mode, therefore a reduced single-degreeof-
freedom model is used to represent the system, specifically a cantilever beam. However, to account
for the effects of higher resonance modes on the first vibration mode, a direct feed-through term is
added to the system model.
An EKF algorithm is developed to estimate the system’s resonance frequency by treating stiffness
as an additional state variable. The estimated resonance frequency is used to adaptively update the
PPF controller parameters, improving vibration suppression, and maintaining robustness.
The presence of the direct feed-through term in the system model equations leads to unconventional
correlations in the EKF formulation. Therefore, the EKF algorithm is re derived to account for these
correlations.
Finally, the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating its ability
to maintain system stability and effectively suppress parasitic vibrations compared to traditional PPF
controllers with fixed parameters.",Master Robotics (M-ROB),"Gharajehdaghi, Kosar",March 2025,English,"No

The findings suggest that while R&D intensity negatively impacts financial performance, engagement in key technologies moderates this effect. The engagement in key technologies and its extent are seen to mitigate the negative impact on operational performance as measured by ROA. However, no significant moderation effect is found for the operational performance as measured by EPS which is said to be due to this variable not being focused solely on operating performance but incorporating some market factors.

applications. This thesis explores if 4G/5G would be a viable option to send data from the drone to a
server/workstation where the data can be used for further data processing. In this thesis, the estimation
of a vehicle’s speed was considered as use case.
A system was designed to send images with Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) and telemetry data
using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol from the drone to a server/worksta-
tion. This RTSP method is reliable and has a latency (time needed to send and fully receive the image)
of around 0.45 seconds for a data stream of 10 FPS with an image size of 724x1280 pixels.
These received images and telemetry data are then used in algorithms to estimate the speed of the
vehicles that can be seen in the images. This is done by making a 3D map with ORB-SLAM,3 which is
connected with 3D GPS coordinates, so a sparse point cloud is created, and these 3D points are in GPS
coordinates. Then, the vehicle’s position is estimated by detecting the objects with YOLO and tracking
these objects with a Bot-SORT tracker. The pixel values of these vehicles are converted to 3D points
with the help of the 3D map, and these 3D locations are then used to estimate the speed of the vehicle.
This implementation is expandable with multiple drones, and the map creation can even be combined
with the help of ORB-SLAM3.
Experimental validation at 120 meters altitude demonstrates that the system that was designed is ca-
pable of sending images and telemetry data using 4G/5G. This system proposes a scalable and flexible

nanoplastics. Fibril-modified membranes were prepared using five different proteins, with seven
fibril aggregation methods tested to optimize their performance. Due to inconsistencies or poor
performance, only α-synuclein and lysozyme fibrils were selected for final experiments to
evaluate their retention efficiency for varying concentrations of fluorescent nanobeads.
The results show that α-synuclein achieved significantly higher retention efficiency, reaching up
to 94%, compared to lysozyme, which reached only 22%. The observed retention trends
deviated from those reported in the existing literature. However, these discrepancies may be
justified by considering the differences in fibril network density, structural integrity, and
interaction strength, all of which may influence retention efficiency.
During experimentation, issues related to membrane integrity and fibril deposition arose.
Imaging showed a buildup of fibrils at membrane edges and tearing under high pressure, which
would later be remedied with a support layer. Furthermore, the number of data points should be

megatrends such as urbanization, sustainability, individualization, and digitization. Of these,
digitization is having the most profound impact, compelling established manufacturers to
rethink their traditional pipeline business models. Therefore, this research explored how
incumbent automotive firms, specifically BMW and Mercedes-Benz, are incorporating
platform ecosystems into their business models.
As the starting point, a review of the existing literature was conducted in order to gain
an initial understanding of the topic and to substantiate the research gap and resulting research
questions. It was followed by a qualitative multiple case study approach where data was
gathered through document analysis. Using the Eisenhardt method, both within-case and
cross-case analyses were performed to explore how these companies integrate platform
ecosystems into traditional business models, providing insights into the challenges and
opportunities of this transformation.
The findings show that the incorporation of the platform ecosystem takes place both

In-car implementation of platform ecosystems has taken a less straight-forward path with
repositioning along the way showing a move from a proprietary approach to the formation of
an industry standard.
As a result, the research showed that integrating a platform ecosystem into a pipeline
business model is complex, with major challenges like the need for industry-wide
standardization to compete against tech giants like Google and Apple. A new role, the

A previously developed dynamic VSA model has been improved through the addition of an equalization process, which  provides the purity benefits of the common blowdown step without its energy require ment and yield trade-off. A mass balance convergence loop has been used to derive a
 function for the equalization pressure. As a result, the equalization pressure can be predicted given the adsorbent material and operating pressures. The validated model was
 used to study several influential parameters in the carbon capture process, namely the duration of individual phases, feed composition, feed velocity, and operating pressures.
 These variables have been tested using Activated Carbon and Zeolite 13X as adsorbent materials. The final design was evaluated based on three performance indicators: ≥80%
 recovery, food-grade purity (≥99.999%), and an energy consumption less than 150 kWh/ton CO2. This design is based on a CO2/N2/H2O mixture, with 12% CO2 and a relative
 humidity of 100%. The presented design is also analyzed for its capital and operational costs, to derive a total capture cost in e/ton CO2 for the system. In practice, the SMR

VP, characterized by depictions of coercion and non-consensual acts, has raised significant concern due to its potential influence on gender perceptions and harmful behaviors. Following the Arksey and O’Malley framework and PRISMA guidelines, the review analyzed seven peer-reviewed studies from 2009 to 2024 across six countries. These studies utilized various methodologies, including cross-sectional surveys, longitudinal designs, experiments, and one meta-analysis. Reported VP consumption ranged from 10.1% to 15.48%, with higher prevalence among individuals exhibiting sexually coercive tendencies.

However, there are many reasons why high school students avoid interacting with fellow students. This project thus aims to create a prototype that is able to lower this barrier of entry to these social interactions and make it easier to visualize these interactions.
With literature research, various factors that are involved in these social interactions are identified. To gain a deeper insight, field research was conducted with high schoolers, where it became clear that most if not all students conduct conversations as their primary way of interacting. Ideation began with the diverging and converging phase, where the main idea was selected, which involved a growing tree that has various flowers and fruits that indicate certain aspects of their conversation, such as how much they spoke or how loudly. Pilot tests were then conducted, and these remained inconclusive as to whether they had a significant positive effect on the conversations.

Traditional epidemic research often assumes either a homogeneous social network or fixed interventions. The assumption of homogeneous social networks ignores any geometric influence, while the assumption of fixed interventions neglects the dynamic relationship between disease prevalence and adherence to interventions. This thesis introduces a novel framework to combine adaptive intervention strategies with geometric random graphs. By introducing adaptive interventions that respond to local and global infection levels, we investigate the impact of different social distancing approaches, including distance-based, weight-based, and infection probability-based interventions. Through extensive simulations on randomly generated as well as real-life networks, we find that both targetting high-degree nodes and targetting long distance edges are effective in reducing peak and total infections. Furthermore, our results show that local information might be beneficial, by focussing interventions on the infected areas. However, the adaptive methods do not consistently outperform the threshold methods, which implies that the feedback relation between adherence to the measures and the disease prevalence does not always have a positive impact.",Master Applied Mathematics (M-AM),"Werf, Luuk van der",March 2025,English,"No

Traditional CFAR algorithms, constrained by fixed hyperparameters, often suffer from target masking, ghost targets, and sensitivity trade-offs, particularly in cluttered and dynamic environments. To address these challenges, firstly hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is performed to explore the full potential of Smallest-Of CFAR(SO-CFAR), Greatest-Of CFAR (GO-CFAR), and Ordered-Statistic CFAR (OS-CFAR) algorithms. The resulting configurations reveal a trade-off between detection sensitivity and false alarm rates, with optimized settings significantly increasing sensitivity compared to baseline performance. Building on this, a novel neural network (NN) detector is introduced that leverages Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds as precise ground truths in a cross-modal training framework. The NN detector, inspired by U-Net architecture is trained using a custom loss function based on a weighted Chamfer distance metric. This loss function incorporates balancing and profile matching terms to guide the network toward generating dense, accurate confidence maps from raw range-Doppler inputs. Experiments on both static radar and sensor-car datasets demonstrate that the proposed NN detector outperforms traditional CFAR methods in sensitivity while maintaining competitive false alarm rates, especially for larger, moving targets. These findings highlight the potential of integrating HPO and cross-modal deep learning to overcome the inherent limitations of conventional radar processing techniques in automotive applications.",Master Embedded Systems (M-EMSYS),"Mahovic, Borna",March 2025,English,"No

As climate risks can lead to financial issues such as asset devaluation and increased operational costs, advancements are needed in this novel field. Existing studies mainly focus on empirically demonstrating the relationship between climate risks and default risk, often ignoring the mechanisms involved. This research bridges this gap by incorporating climate risks into structural default risk models, which treat default endogenously. The study's contributions are twofold. First, it introduces a novel methodology adapting the asset value channel of the Merton jump diffusion model to integrate climate risks, validated through a case study using PGGM's corporate bond portfolio. The model's behaviour aligns with economic theory, indicating its suitability for quantifying climate risks. Second, the case study reveals a relatively small average impact of climate risks on default risk, however, significant shocks are observed in fast-transitioning scenarios.

106078,3D-modelling of turbulent flow and bed shear stress around vegetation : Effects of scour and bending,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106078,"Salt marshes and vegetated foreshores have recently obtained more attention. The functions of these
vegetated planes are to stabilize the coastline and reduce the flood risk (Temmerman et al., 2023).
Sediment transport within the salt marsh happens at lower velocities, due to the vegetation. The
erosion of a salt marsh can therefore threaten the flood safety provided by the salt marsh. In several
studies the vegetation has been simplified to cylinders (e.g. Baptist et al., 2007; Baptist et al.,
2005; Conde-Frias et al., 2023; Etminan et al., 2018). Some studies focused on a straight cylinder
and the scour around a cylinder (e.g. Aksel et al., 2021; Kirkil et al., 2008; Roulund et al., 2005).
Based on the studies with scour can be concluded that the effect on the flow field and bed shear
stress. Since the bending of vegetation is important for the wave attenuation (Temmerman et al.,
2023) and flow field. Others focused on the inclination of a cylinder (e.g. Aksel, 2023; Kitsikoudis
et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020). The inclination of a cylinder also alters the flow field. This leaves
two important factors for the alteration of the flow, which are bending and scour. This leaves a
knowledge gap in what the combined effect is of scour and inclination on the flow field and bed
shear stress. This leads to the research question, which is: ”How does the bending of vegetation
and scour of the bottom affect the flow structure and bed shear stress?”. The cases were with an
inclination angle of 0° and 14° and a flat bed and scoured bed simulation, leading to four cases in
total. The problem has been modelled using a RANS k − ωSST model in OpenFOAM. The model
has been validated on the experimental data of Kitsikoudis et al. (2017). The validation was for the
main regions within 10% of the normalized velocities. The flow field changes for an inclined cylinder.
For a straight cylinder the upstream flow bends down upstream of the cylinder resulting in the HV.
The flow crosses the cylinder horizontally. Close to the bottom the HV reconnects downstream of
the cylinder. In the wake the main fluctuations are in transverse and streamwise direction. For the
inclined cylinder the flow partially bends upwards resulting in a weaker HV. Instead of crossing the
cylinder horizontally, the flow crosses the cylinder under an angle. Further is there an increase in
vertical velocity behind the cylinder. The TKE also decreases for the inclined case, where vertical
fluctuations had the largest contribution to the TKE. The introduction of scour resulted in an
additional HV inside the scour hole. The scour hole reduces the bed shear stress in the scour hole.
Downstream of the scour hole, sediment deposition ridge is formed. At this location the bed shear
stress has therefore increased compared to the flat bed case. The bed shear stress is around the
same order, but the largest bed shear stresses were measured inside the scour hole. Compared to
the bed shear stress amplification is the bed shear stress fluctuation relatively small. In the flow
field the TKE decreases due to scour and inclination. However, the simulation with an inclined
cylinder and scoured bed showed some discrepancies. To conclude the bending of vegetation ans
scour around the vegetation is important as it lowers the capacity for sediment transport, meaning
that salt marshes will be more stable over time.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"Buijs, Hilbert",March 2025,English,"No

This study explores the direct relationship between Cybersecurity Maturity and Competitive Advantage in SMEs, filling a significant gap in the existing literature where quantitative proof is absent. While much of the existing research focuses on large corporations, this study offers empirical evidence of how cybersecurity maturity can serve as a powerful competitive differentiator for SMEs. 
The study employs a quantitative, non-experimental correlational design, analysing key constructs such as Cybersecurity Maturity, Competitive Advantage, regulatory compliance, and the frequency of cyber incidents. Data was collected through a cross-sectional self-assessment survey targeting SMEs, and the analysis was conducted using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with ADANCO. 
The results of this study reveal a statistically significant direct effect of Cybersecurity Maturity on Competitive Advantage. SMEs with higher levels of Cybersecurity Maturity experience enhanced customer trust, operational resilience, and market differentiation factors contributing to long-term success. This supports the concept that cybersecurity investments should be viewed as a strategic asset, enabling SMEs to gain a Competitive Advantage. 
This study shifts the conversation around cybersecurity from being a cost to adding value. It demonstrates that SMEs prioritizing Cybersecurity Maturity do not just protect their businesses; they can use it to gain a sustainable Competitive Advantage. By presenting quantitative evidence of cybersecurity’s role in Competitive Advantage, this research provides SMEs with a compelling business case to invest in cybersecurity as a driver of growth and differentiation.

106072,Modeling The JLO Exoskeleton and Designing a Controller for Gait Entrainment,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106072,"Gait entrainment occurs when a human synchronizes the period of their gait cycle
to the period of an external, rhythmic input. Gait entrainment can be done with an
ankle exoskeleton; the exoskeleton delivers small torque pulses to the human ankle
provoking a subconscious adaptation of gait cadence.
Researchers from the Neuromuscular Robotics research group at the University
of Twente use the JLO, a lower limb exoskeleton, to study gait entrainment. The
JLO’s current controller was designed using model-free techniques, and provides
sub-standard torque tracking, severely limiting the ability to investigate gait entrainment.
Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to create a model of the exoskeleton
that facilitates controller design, and to use that model in designing a controller that
minimizes the error between the desired torque pulses and the measured pulses.
To this end, the JLO is modeled as a nonlinear system. The combination of feedback
linearizing control and feedforward control results in a lower root mean square
error (RMSE) than the JLO’s current, model-free controller. Simulation experiments
showed that when tracking torque pulses, the proposed controller has an RMSE of
0.6361 Nm, while the current controller has an RMSE of 0.7368 Nm. The feedback
linearizing controller thus improves the current torque tracking capabilities of the
JLO exoskeleton, and better facilitates the study of gait entrainment as a rehabilitative
strategy. Master Mechanical Engineering (M-ME)",Master Systems and Control (M-SC),"Iroagalachi, Grace C.",March 2025,English,"No.

the design of urban bus systems using a multimodal social welfare maximization model in the
city of Enschede, the Netherlands. The model allows users to choose between taking a bus,
driving a car, walking, or taking the bike inside a transportation corridor, while optimizing
variables bus fare, congestion toll, bus frequency, and bus size. In addition to congestion, this
study looks at environmental externalities and how they affect sustainable urban mobility. The
transition from private cars to public transportation dramatically reduces carbon emissions and
pollution levels along the corridor, cutting the externality costs associated with motorized
mobility. However, increased bus frequency leads to environmental externalities, especially
for conventionally fueled buses. This emphasizes the importance of electrification techniques,
better energy sources, and effective bus fleet management in balancing service gains with
environmental effects. Furthermore, the use of bicycles and walking contributing to
environmentally friendly and sustainable mobility. These two modes of transportation produce
no externalities or pollution and are cost-free, making them particularly attractive for shorter
distances, as highlighted in this study.
The findings highlight the need of considering long-term environmental sustainability in

what the difference between statistical, iconographic 2D and physical 3D visualizations
is with regards to minimizing cognitive load and fostering environmental
awareness.
By following a HCD process, two MR prototypes were developed for the HoloLens
2 which depicted invisible gas leak data. They were evaluated through a survey and
usability study with 14 experts and non-experts, using SAGAT, NASA-TLX and other
questionnaires.
The results suggest that there is no significant difference between statistical,
iconographic 2D and physical 3D visualizations in terms of environmental awareness
and cognitive load. However, an analysis of the effect size and qualitative
post-interview data imply that the physical 3D visualization led to a higher environmental
awareness in all its three dimensions, while an analysis of the cognitive load
sub-dimensions indicate that the statistical, iconographic 2D visualization was better
suited for lowering cognitive load.",Master Interaction Technology (M-ITECH),"Schwuchow, Julia Dang Linh",January 2025,English,"No

106067,"Communication Errors in Investigative Interviews: The Impact of Judgment, Factual and Contextual Errors on Trust, Rapport and Willingness to Provide Information",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106067,"Effective communication is crucial in investigative interviews to gather reliable information during criminal investigations. This study explores the impact of communication errors - factual, judgment, and contextual - on suspects' trust, rapport, and willingness to provide information. Building on previous research by Oostinga et al. (2018b), we introduce contextual errors to the existing framework of factual and judgment errors. A between-groups experimental design was employed, with participants assigned to one of four conditions: Judgment Error, Factual Error, Contextual Error, or Control. Results show that while overall trust was not significantly affected by errors, benevolence-based trust (affective trust) was notably reduced by judgment errors. Both judgment and factual errors negatively impacted rapport, with judgment errors having a particularly pronounced effect. However, contextual errors had a subtle influence on rapport when noticed, but did not significantly affect any other outcomes, including willingness to provide information. The study also highlights the importance of error detection, showing that participants' awareness of errors generally led to lower levels of trust, rapport, and willingness to provide information, especially when judgment and factual errors were detected. Limitations, including the low error detection rate and the online setting, point to the need for more immersive research methods. The results emphasize the importance of avoiding judgment errors to foster affective trust in investigative interviews. Recommendations for practice and future research are discussed to further examine communication errors and their implications for investigative interviews and other high-stakes interactions.

A weekly diary study was conducted with Dutch master's students completing internships. Participants rated their experiences regarding emotions and psychological need fulfillment. The analysis revealed that FGS reported lower competence at the end of their internships compared to continuing-generation students (CGS), but there were no differences in autonomy or relatedness. Higher average negative emotions predicted lower need fulfillment for all students, but emotional variability had different effects. CGS with fluctuating emotions experienced lower competence and relatedness, while for FGS, variability was linked to increased autonomy. FGS seemed less affected by persistent negative emotions, whereas CGS showed a stronger decline in need fulfillment when facing such emotions. These findings suggest that FGS may have developed strategies to maintain autonomy despite emotional challenges, while CGS appear more vulnerable to professional setbacks.

Hengelo, applying SLP to improve storage utilization, transport efficiency, and operational 
workflow. The research aims to identify a suitable depot configuration by comparing multiple 
layout scenarios and evaluating them based on KPIs and heuristic analysis. 
A mixed-methods approach was employed, integrating facility mapping, spatial analysis, and 
stakeholder input to identify existing inefficiencies. Three layout scenarios were developed based 
on available storage space, operational constraints, and transport flow. The layouts were 
evaluated using KPI-based scoring and heuristic ranking to determine the most effective design. 
Additionally, a queueing model was applied to assess potential delays in truck processing and 
barge transport operations. 
The study concluded that Scenario 1, which separates clean and unclean tank containers, was the 
most effective layout configuration. The queueing analysis indicated that while truck processing 
operates near full capacity, barge loading experiences occasional delays, particularly when 
regular container volumes fluctuate. The findings support the feasibility of the proposed layout, 
ensuring cost-effective depot operations with minimal transport congestion. 
The results provide actionable recommendations for ITG Hengelo and Cleaning Twente, offering

Subthreshold psychopathology, characterized by symptoms below the clinical threshold required for diagnosing a mental disorder, is associated with functional impairments and increased healthcare costs. Mindfulness has been identified as a protective factor against mental disorders and their subthreshold expressions, potentially through its influence on emotion regulation strategies such as acceptance and rumination. However, the relationship between mindfulness and psychopathology under consideration of acceptance and rumination as simultaneous working mechanisms was not yet investigated. Aim. This study examines the mediating roles of acceptance and rumination in the relationship between mindfulness and psychopathology. Methods. A cross-sectional secondary data analysis was conducted using self-report measures from 58 participants. Mindfulness was assessed with the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, acceptance and rumination with the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and psychopathology with the Symptom Checklist-90-R. A parallel mediation model was tested using Structural Equation Modeling, with bootstrapping applied. Results. Mindfulness was significantly negatively associated with psychopathology. However, neither acceptance nor rumination significantly mediated this relationship. Both acceptance and rumination showed a small, positive correlation with psychopathology. Model fit indices indicated acceptable model quality. Discussion. The findings confirm mindfulness as a protective factor against psychopathology but do not support mediation via acceptance or rumination. Possible explanations include opposing indirect effects canceling each other out and limited statistical power. Future research should explore potential moderators, distinguish adaptive from maladaptive acceptance, and utilize longitudinal designs to clarify causal relationships.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Giszas, J.",March 2025,English,"No

cadastral and mapping agency. By analyzing the current question answering system of
KKG, we identify its limitations and implement our approach on KKG to verify its feasibility. By conducting this research project, we aim to validate our approach and answer

Moreover, this study analyses how buffering and bridging strategies are interrelated. These relationships are examined using a policy-capturing experiment conducted at a case company in the Netherlands. The results show that buyer dependence and perceived supplier dependence positively influence the focal company’s likelihood of implementing bridging approaches. Additionally, buyer dependence has a positive (negative) influence on the focal company’s likelihood of implementing buffering strategies if perceived supplier dependence is low (high). Furthermore, while focal company’s trust has a positive influence on the focal company’s likelihood of implementing bridging strategies, it is negatively related to the implementation of buffering strategies.

106054,Evaluation of the excavation of the spillways in the dikes along the Linge and Waal in case of an inundation of dike ring 43,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106054,"The Netherlands famously is a low-lying country at the mouth of several Europe’s largest rivers. But 
due to the low elevation of the country, river floods have always posed a threat. As much as 29 
percent of the country is at risk from flooding of the major rivers (Planbureau voor de Leefomgeving, 
2024).
The Dutch doctrine to protect the low-lying areas from floodings from both rivers and the sea
revolves around dividing the low-lying areas into so-called dike rings. Each dike ring is a section of
low lying area surrounded and protected by primary flood defences (such as dikes, weirs and dunes) 
and higher lying terrain.
As the Rhine enters the Netherlands it splits into several different branches. The two main branches 
are formed by the Nederrijn and its continuation the Lek in the north and the Waal in the south. In 
between these branches two middle-sized dike rings are located: dike ring 43 upstream and dike ring 
16 downstream. The border between the two dike rings is formed by a dry dike called the Diefdijk. 
The Diefdijk protects the downstream dike ring 16 in case that the upstream dike ring 43 is 
inundated. 
In between the Nederrijn and the Waal flows the Linge, a small river that lies completely within dike 
rings 16 and 43. The dikes along the Linge are lower than the dikes running along the Nederrijn and 
Waal and do not form a part of the primary flood defences protecting dike rings 16 and 43 from the 
large rivers. The dikes along the Linge do however provide an extra barrier if the upstream dike ring 
43 is inundated. 
To help to alleviate the load on the Diefdijk during an inundation of dike ring 43, the Lingewerken are 
constructed. The Lingewerken consist of a series of spillways in the dikes of the rivers Linge and
Waal. If in the case of an inundation the water level in dike ring 43 is higher than in the Waal, the 
spillways of the Lingewerken can be activated to guide flood water from dike ring 43 (back) into the 
Waal. 
While research from the 1990s has shown the positive effect of the Lingewerken on the safety of dike 
ring 16, little research has been conducted about the effect of the Lingewerken on dike ring 43. Also, 
the effect of the Lingewerken has only been quantified in terms of a water level reduction, but not in 
terms of damage and casualties. The research objective of the project is to evaluate for which flood 
scenarios of dike ring 43 it is advantageous to use the Lingewerken in order to prevent as many 
casualties and as much economic damage as possible.
The research is conducted by integrating the Lingewerken in the latest flood model of dike ring 43 of 
Waterboard Rivierenland, utilising D-HYDRO software. The subsequently found effect of the 
Lingewerken on the flood water level is then evaluated by using the Schade- en Slachtoffer Module 
(translated: Damage and Victims Module) to find the expected reduction in economic damage and 
amount of casualties.
The effect of the Lingewerken on preventing damage and casualties is evaluated for two different 
dike breach events. The first evaluation assesses the benefit of the spillways along the Waal and the 
Linge for a very severe inundation scenario (return period 1/10000 years) with a dike breach location 
south of Tiel. It is found that in case of a large scale inundation of dike ring 43, excavation of the 
spillways along the Waal reduces the size of the inundation considerably. The amount of damage and 
casualties is significantly lower by excavating the spillways along the Waal. On the other hand, 
excavation of the spillways along the Linge in addition to the spillways along the Waal has a limited effect. By excavating the spillways along the Linge, the spread of the inundation is accelerated but 
the size of the inundation stays more or less the same. 
The second evaluation is conducted to answer whether or not it is beneficial to excavate the 
spillways along the Linge and the Waal if there is a smaller-sized inundation from the north near 
Beusichem (return period 1/100 years). In a scenario without utilisation of the spillways, the dikes 
along the Linge form a barrier for the inundation to spread further causing significant water levels 
north of the Linge but low water levels south of the Linge. By excavating the spillways in the dikes 
along the Linge and, the water levels north of the Linge are reduced but the inundation spreads 
further south before leaving the dike ring through the spillways along the Waal. It is found that when 
the spillways are excavated, the decrease in damage and amount of victims north of the Linge does 
not weigh up to the extra damage and casualties south of the Linge. Excavation of the spillways along 
the Waal and Linge is therefore disadvantageous in case of a smaller-sized inundation from the 
north. 
It can be concluded that for both assessed flood events, a severe flood coming from the south of Tiel 
and a less severe flood from the north near Beusichem, disadvantageous to excavate the Linge 
spillways as the excavation of the Linge spillways leads to more casualties and economic damage. On 
the other hand, it is certainly advantageous to excavate the Waal spillways in case of a large scale 
flood south of the Linge in order to reduce the damage and amount of casualties significantly. 
A conclusion that the usage of the Linge spillways is disadvantageous for every flood scenario might
however be premature based on only two investigated dike breach scenarios. A scenario not 
investigated where the Linge spillways could prove to be useful is in case of a large scale inundation 
north of the Linge from the Nederrijn. Excavation of the Linge spillways in addition the Waal spillways 
could provide a quick way for the flood water to leave dike ring 43 thereby reducing the size of the 
inundation. Therefore the recommendation is made to investigate the effect of the spillways along 
the Linge for a large scale inundation from Nederrijn before drawing definitive conclusions about the 
Linge spillways.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Janse, Stijn van",March 2025,English,"No

The ABC method was used to allocate costs more precisely, while regression analysis identified key cost drivers and inefficiencies in cost estimation. Data from production logs and financial reports was analysed, and expert interviews were conducted to validate the models. The study confirmed that implementing a structured cost accounting method, combined with regression-based budget analysis, significantly improves cost transparency and financial control.

106050,CIR of surface courses : A Gap analysis of RAP gradation characteristics,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106050,"Globally, the recycling of construction and demolition waste (CDW) has become an important element in the construction industry. The road industry, in particular, has adopted this
element very well. In the Netherlands, recycling rates of up to 100% are reached regarding
Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP). However, in the case of surface courses, this RAP material is mostly recycled in the form of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA). This requires a considerable
amount of energy compared to Cold Mix Asphalt (CMA), which is undesirable. However,
partly due to the material properties of RAP, CMA’s with 100% RAP are unsuitable for
surface courses. NTP, a Dutch innovative and sustainable operating company in the Grond-,
Weg- en Waterbouw (GWW) sector wants to find a way to ensure that cold in-situ recycling (CIR) can be applied to surface courses and potentially be able to define what asphalt
pavement surfaces are eligible for this rehabilitation treatment.
This study focuses on improving the gradation characteristics of RAP material by performing
a gap analysis. In this gap analysis, the state-of-practice regarding cold milling equipment and
processes and their impact on RAP gradation is identified. This is done through a systematic
literature review and a sieve analysis performed in accordance with NEN-EN 12697-2. This
RAP gradation is then compared to the regulations defined in the NEN-Norms and the
CROW Standaard RAW bepalingen 2020, to define the quality gap. Based on this quality
gap, solutions for improving the RAP gradation and ultimately bridge the quality gap are
identified. These solutions are then evaluated based on their potential effectiveness to bridge
the quality gap. For the most suitable solution, an impact analysis was performed.
In this study, it was found that the current cold milling equipment and process caused high
RAP clustering, leading to the material being too coarse graded compared to the regulations.
CIR can either be applied with a single-unit train or a multi-unit train, with solutions including optimizing travel speed and drum configuration (pick spacing and cutting direction)
for the single-unit train, and adding a mobile crushing and screening unit for the multi-unit
train. Additionally, two other hypothetical solutions were identified: Ultrasonic vibrations
and steam induced asphalt-aggregate segregations. However, these solutions were not tested
and developed sufficiently to be applied in the field. Of the other two options, optimizing
the operating parameters and the drum configuration appeared to be the best option based
on expert opinion and equipment availability. Reducing the travel speed and the pick spacing while ensuring a down-cutting motion of the milling drum, can result in a finer graded
RAP material. In the impact analysis, it was concluded that if the assumptions for the
effect of the travel speed and the pick spacing are accurate, the gradation of RAP material
will be in accordance with the regulations in most scenarios. This suggests that this solution can potentially effectively reduce the effect of clustering and thereby improve the RAP
gradation.
To improve the accuracy of the results, the effect of the operating parameters and drum configuration has to be further researched. Additionally, it has to be determined if the resulting
RAP gradations are of sufficient quality to create a CMA, which is in accordance with the
required performance properties defined in the Standaard RAW bepalingen 2020.",Bachelor Civil Engineering (B-CE),"Arling, Milan",February 2025,English,"No.

Additionally, mobility data from the Nederlands Verplaatsingspanel (NVP), provided by Goudappel, was analysed to determine optimal temperatures for active travel, finding that walking peaks at 21ºC and cycling at 29ºC, with 24.5ºC identified as the optimal temperature for active mobility overall. Spatial analysis of walking and cycling patterns on days above and below optimal temperatures revealed that although high temperatures generally reduce active mobility, people continue walking in city centres, which often have the highest PET values. However, within these centres, there is a slight preference for shaded routes on hotter days (16% versus 13% on non-shaded links). Outside the city centre, walking decreases more significantly on unshaded links (-16%) compared to shaded ones (-10%). These findings suggest that while people may not consciously choose routes based on perceived temperature variations, they may prefer 
tree-lined streets for their cooling benefits. This highlights the importance of integrating urban greenery into 
mobility planning to support sustainable transport and climate resilience. Keywords: Nature-based Solutions, Sustainable Transport, Active mobility, Urban Heat, PET, Nederlands

106048,Exploring Error Recovery Strategies in Teleoperated Systems,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106048,"Teleoperated robots are increasingly employed in environments requiring precision and safety. However, system errors remain inevitable; therefore, appropriate error recovery solutions are needed. This study investigates how different error recovery strategies influence operator performance and behaviour during a teleoperation task. Three strategies
were tested: smooth recovery, rapid recovery, and no recovery, using a within-subject design. Performance metrics included hit scores and unclutching behaviour, while qualitative feedback provided insights into user preferences and experiences. Results indicated no significant overall effect of recovery strategy on performance, though post hoc analysis
revealed differences between specific strategies. User preferences significantly impacted performance, highlighting the importance of aligning system behaviour with operator expectations. The findings underscore the need for adaptive recovery strategies tailored to user needs, enhancing the effectiveness of teleoperated systems. Future research should

106047,Procedural Justice Dialogues to Enhance the Youth-Police Relationship including VR Technology: The Positive Police Contact Intervention (PPCI),https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106047,"A positive relationship between young people and the police contributes to social cohesion, institutional trust, and public safety. Research has shown that frequent negative interactions with law enforcement can undermine these relationships, particularly among youths from structurally disadvantaged neighborhoods and ethnic minority backgrounds. Procedural Justice Theory (PJT) suggests that police officers' treatment of citizens—whether they (1) treat them with dignity and respect, (2) display trustworthy motives, (3) make unbiased decisions, and (4) provide opportunities for citizens to express their views—shapes their identification with society and law enforcement. In turn, this identification influences trust in the police and perceptions of police legitimacy, two key determinants for lawful behavior and cooperation with law enforcement.
In response to these challenges, the Positive Police Contact Intervention (PPCI) was developed to facilitate positive, meaningful interactions between police officers and youths. The intervention aimed to foster perspective taking and mutual understanding through structured dialogues supported by virtual reality (VR) technology. This study examines the design, implementation, and evaluation of the PPCI across 16 intervention sessions in various Dutch cities, involving over 130 youths and 10 police officers. Using a mixed-methods approach, the study assesses the intervention's impact on youths' perceptions of procedural justice, trust in law enforcement, police legitimacy, social identity, and career interest in policing, measured before and after the intervention. Qualitative data were collected to capture youths’ evaluations of the intervention.
Findings indicate that 80% of the youths had a positive experience, and 64% reported feeling able to express themselves during the interaction. Dialogues centered on (1) police decision making, (2) youths’ perceptions and experiences with the police, and (3) profession-related topics. Youths particularly valued (1) the VR experience, (2) exchanging perspectives, and (3) the educational aspects of the intervention. Correlational analyses revealed strong associations between procedural justice perceptions, trust, legitimacy, identification with the Netherlands and the police, and career interest in policing. The intervention did not significantly alter procedural justice perceptions, trust, legitimacy, or career interest in policing. Notably, however, identification with Dutch society increased, while identification with the police decreased. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed to inform law enforcement strategies, future research, and intervention design aiming to enhance the youth-police relationship.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Siepenkort, Tobias",March 2025,English,"No

106046,"What if the Lower Limb Knee’ds to be Realigned? A Standardised Protocol for Semi-Automatic Lower Limb Alignment in Preoperative Planning of Corrective Surgery: A Collaborative Research With MST, UMCG, and UMCU",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106046,"Introduction – Proper lower limb function relies on balanced force distribution across the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Femoral or tibial malalignment disrupts this balance, causing mechanical impairments. Corrective surgery aims to restore alignment, but conventional 2D/3D planning methods can cause unintended corrections. In collaboration with MST, UMCG, and UMCU, this thesis presents a standardised, clinically implementable protocol for semi-automatic lower limb alignment in frontal, sagittal, and axial directions to improve preoperative planning. Method – A 3D semi-automated alignment protocol is developed by reviewing literature, internal protocols, and reaching consensus among MST, UMCG, and UMCU. The protocol, scripted in Python 3.8, requires minimal user input. Reproducibility is assessed through intra- and interrater variability. Accuracy is evaluated by comparing 2D and 3D angle measurements across AP/lateral radiographs, non-weightbearing CT, and weightbearing-adjusted CT. Implementation in HTO planning assesses the impact of coordinate systems on virtual postoperative results and patient-specific guide design. Results – The protocol is developed with partial consensus, lacking agreement on the femoral condyle centre. Intra- and interobserver variability analysis demonstrates high robustness (ICC > 0.90), with low maximal angle discrepancies except for a few measures of moderate reliability. Accuracy analysis reveals significant differences between 2D and 3D measurements, indicating these are not interchangeable. Clinical implementation improves surgical planning by ensuring accurate coordinate system usage and enhancing guide design. Discussion – The initial UMCG mechanical approach proves most robust. Key limitations include a small, heterogeneous sample, variability in joint surface marking, inconsistencies in 3D segmentation, and inaccuracies in manual 2D-3D matching. The long-term clinical benefits of patient-specific guides remain unproven. Future research should focus on clinical outcomes and integrating 3D musculoskeletal models with gait analysis to determine optimal alignment before heavily investing in technical protocol improvements. Conclusion – This 3D protocol enables precise, multi-planar adjustments, minimising unintended corrections and enhancing preoperative planning and surgical guide development. It may ultimately improve personalised surgical planning and patient outcomes in corrective surgery.",Master Technical Medicine (M-TM),"Rhebergen, A.",March 2025,English,"No.

106043,Integraal werken bij de gemeente Almelo,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106043,"In a changing world, governments are constantly reinventing themselves. For instance, 
in an increasingly crowded public space, it is important to tackle change holistically. By 
taking a cross-sectoral look at assets and city layout, it is possible to work more efficiently 
and effectively. This requires a new way of working, from side by side to with each other.
One way to work more efficiently and effectively is to integrate policies. Much research 
has already been done on this. However, the consequences of policy integration and how 
integrality can also play an important role in implementation remain underexposed in 
this. This study explores the meaning of integral working for the employees of the 
municipality of Almelo dealing with the physical domain. Eleven interviews provide 
insight into how employees think about integral working, how they are already engaged
in it, and where they see obstacles and opportunities to grow into it. 
This shows that integral working is a familiar concept to the employees of the 
municipality of Almelo. For them, it mainly means involving multiple disciplines and 
parties. This does not always go well yet due to a lack of common goals. Goals that 
contribute to cooperative engagement of colleagues in projects. In addition, there is poor 
insight into the current state of the infrastructure and the tasks of the fields. This slows 
down cooperation. 
The four levels of integral working mentioned in the theory are recognised by employees. 
Work with the scope of an entire neighbourhood or district lends itself best to the linking 
level. Co-linking includes work by work fields that do not have priority or resources in an 
area where another work field does. Others then have the opportunity to link up, after 
which the work shifts to (co-)linking or monodisciplinary work. Mono-disciplinary work is 
work where no one links up or where it is not possible to link up, such as small-scale 
maintenance and implementation, and research activities.
On the other hand, activities are complex and cannot always be placed at one of the 
levels of integrated working. Activities change over time and so does the need for integral 
working. For instance, one field of work is coordinated while another field of work can 
also link in. Classifying activities on a level is tailor-made and not always possible.
In order to tackle activities more integrally, this study concludes with four recommendations for the municipality of Almelo. First, it is essential to have the data in order to 
maintain speed in the cooperation. In addition, formulating widely supported goals helps 
to put projects in a broader perspective, increase commitment, and stimulate targeted 
efforts. Thirdly, it is recommended to develop a framework to structurally embed integral 
working in the organisation. Finally, it is important to monitor and evaluate integral 
working to learn lessons and implement improvements in processes.",Master Public Administration (M-PA),"Swinkels, M.W.A.",March 2025,Dutch,"No

106042,Reframing bookkeeping : Supporting young entrepreneurs in overcoming financial challenges,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106042,"Many young entrepreneurs face challenges in navigating the financial complexities of entrepreneurship. This suggests an opportunity to refine existing tools or develop new solutions. This thesis examines the entrepreneurial journey of young, aspiring entrepreneurs aged between 14 and 25, identifying the phases they encounter in setting up their businesses and understanding their needs. This study is conducted for Moneybird, a bookkeeping software company, with the main goal of understanding how Moneybird can support young entrepreneurs in addressing financial challenges during the startup phase.
This study employs qualitative, multi-layered user research using sensitisation tools, interviews, and generative sessions. The findings reveal that young entrepreneurs often encounter a 'gap' after registering with the Chamber of Commerce. This 'gap' represents a transition period where the perception of bookkeeping shifts from a tax obligation to a valuable tool for insight and decision-making. Information about regulations often overwhelms entrepreneurs in this phase, leading them to perceive bookkeeping as tedious and obligatory. However, when entrepreneurs want to invest, grow, or transition from part-time to full-time, they recognise the importance of bookkeeping for making informed financial decisions. At that point, they often opt for a paid bookkeeping package like Moneybird.
The results of this study indicate that Moneybird should reframe bookkeeping from a compliance burden to a powerful tool for insight, decision-making, and growth, helping entrepreneurs recognise its value earlier in their journey. By simplifying the onboarding process, providing clear guidance, and building confidence in financial skills, Moneybird can alleviate entrepreneurs’ anxieties about bookkeeping. Encouraging users to maintain complete and accurate records from the start prevents unexpected financial issues and enables more strategic decision-making. Beyond simplifying bookkeeping, Moneybird can position itself as a growth partner by incorporating visual, data-driven reports that predict future figures based on known data. 
The focus of further research is on identifying the data required for predictions and enhancing their relevance and usefulness for entrepreneurs. By emphasising the value of financial insight and planning, Moneybird will become an indispensable partner for business success.",Master Industrial Design Engineering (M-IDE),"Andel, Meggie van",March 2025,English,"No

This thesis develops a conceptual comparison framework to assess the performance of Bouwvervoer’s current semi-digital manual route planning system versus a pilot AI-driven alternative. Eight Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were selected to capture operational efficiency, employee satisfaction, and customer service quality. Their relative importance was determined through the Multiplicative Analytic Hierarchy Process (MAHP) based on expert input from company stakeholders. The framework incorporates three analytical tools: Descriptive Statistics to assess performance variability, Weighted Composite Score (WCS) to provide an overall performance metric, and Weighted Difference Analysis (WDA) to reveal KPI-specific gaps between systems. Due to limited operational availability, these methods were implemented in an interactive Power BI dashboard using mock-up data. Evaluation feedback from the company supervisor confirmed the dashboard’s usability and strategic value while suggesting improvements for future development.

106040,Scrolling through misinformation : health anxiety and media trust among Dutch Generation Z.,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106040,"Background: Health misinformation spreads rapidly through social media and may contribute to increased health anxiety and declining media trust, especially among Generation Z. This study investigates the relationship between health misinformation, health anxiety and media trust among Dutch Generation Z, focusing on the role of misinformation recognition and previous misinformation experiences. In addition, the moderating effects of emotional involvement, trait anxiety and media literacy are analysed.
Method: A cross-sectional online survey study was conducted among 198 Dutch adolescents (16 - 29 years). Participants were recruited via social media and educational institutions. Validated scales were used to measure recognising and experiencing health misinformation, health anxiety, media trust, emotional involvement, trait anxiety, and media literacy. Data analysis was conducted with linear regression and moderation subgroup analysis. 
Results: The results show a significant negative relationship between recognising health misinformation and health anxiety. In addition, a negative relationship was found between experiences with health misinformation and media trust. No relationships were found for the other direct correlations. The moderation analysis shows that trait anxiety eliminates the negative relationship between misinformation recognition and health anxiety, while media literacy weakens the negative relationship between experiences with health misinformation and media trust. Other moderations were not significant.
Conclusion: The results show that recognizing misinformation reduces health anxiety, but its effectiveness depends on individual differences, such as psychological predispositions. Misinformation experiences go hand in hand with lower media confidence, with media literacy acting as a protective factor. This underlines the importance of both cognitive and emotional factors in the processing of misinformation. Future interventions should focus not only on media literacy, but also on psychological resilience to misinformation.

106037,CLAIR : Generating On-Demand Low-Code Application Documentation through Knowledge Graph and LLM-based Multi-Agent System Integration,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106037,"Low-Code has revolutionised software development by enabling rapid application creation with minimal coding effort. However, as Low-Code applications scale, challenges related to documentation, maintainability, and technical debt become increasingly prevalent. Inadequate documentation impedes collaboration, maintenance, troubleshooting, and knowledge retention, particularly in agile development environments where documentation is often disregarded. This thesis introduces CLAIR (Connecting Low-Code and Artificial Intelligence for RAG), an AI-driven documentation assistant that leverages a knowledge graph and a LLM-based Multi Agent System to generate on-demand, context-aware documentation for Low-Code applications. The tool is validated using the Mendix platform, and the study employs a Design Science Methodology to design, develop, and validate the proposed solution. A comprehensive literature review explores challenges in Low-Code documentation, emphasising issues such as fragmented knowledge, poor traceability, and the impact of missing documentation. A survey and case study at CAPE Groep, an Low-Code consultancy firm, further highlight the documentation needs of Low-Code developers and business analysts. To address these issues, CLAIR integrates knowledge graphs to structure and store Low-Code application data, enabling efficient querying and multi-hop reasoning. Additionally, a Multi-Agent LLM System dynamically generates and enhances documentation based on application data and user queries. CLAIR automates documentation generation across various phases of the Low-Code Development Lifecycle, including the design, development, and maintenance phases. Key features include automated extraction of domain models, microflows, and dependencies, generation of high-level summaries and technical details, and support for troubleshooting. The system enhances maintainability, knowledge retention, and team collaboration by ensuring up-to-date, structured, and queryable on-demand documentation. Validation was conducted through expert evaluations and a series of test cases using Technical Action Research, demonstrating CLAIR's ability to generate accurate, usable, and context-aware documentation. Findings indicate that automated documentation significantly reduces the time and effort needed to create high-quality documentation. This documentation leads to reduced cognitive load, technical debt, and maintenance effort, making it a valuable asset for Low-Code development teams. This research contributes to the fields of Low-Code development, automated documentation, and AI-driven knowledge management, proposing an innovative approach that combines knowledge graphs and LLMs to enhance documentation processes. By bridging the gap between Low-Code application development and AI-driven automation, CLAIR sets a foundation for future advancements in intelligent Low-Code documentation and maintainability solutions.",Master Business Information Technology (M-BIT),"Eichhorn, Tim",March 2025,English,"No.

106035,Transforming Care Pathways with Digital Technologies : A Case Study in High-Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106035,"Background: The pressure on healthcare systems is rising due to an aging population, limited resources, and changing patient expectations. Care pathways streamline processes within specific patient groups to enhance quality, and digital technologies like telemonitoring and telecommunication are emerging as solutions. However, it remains unclear how care pathways should integrate these technologies for optimal quality improvement.
Objective: The aim of this study was to explore how care pathways can be transformed through the integration of digital technologies to enhance patient outcomes, patient experience, clinician well-being, and healthcare equity. This research focuses on redesigning the diagnostic process for non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients to improve care delivery.
Methods: The study involved two main parts: a scoping review to identify validated methodologies for redesigning care pathways with digital technologies, and a case study applying the Rijnstate approach. The Rijnstate approach, a non-validated methodology developed through practical experience at Rijnstate Hospital, was enhanced with data mining and process mining techniques and applied to the high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma care pathway. The case study aimed to identify improvements in the redesign by evaluating its impact using historical data and a deterministic analytical model while assessing the added value of incorporating quantitative methodologies into the Rijnstate approach.
Results: 14 articles address the integration of digital technologies in care pathway design. Identified methods included among others interviews, multidisciplinary meetings, and process discovery. Digital technologies such as telemonitoring, telecommunication, and electronic patient record optimization were seen in these care pathways, but no validated methodology was found. The Rijnstate approach was supplemented with data analysis to map current processes, revealing new insights to the care team and enabling calculation for impact analysis. Potential improvements to the HG-NHL care pathway included digital information provision, self-check kiosks, medication verification, and fast-track diagnostics. These interventions reduced the workload for specialists by 16 minutes per patient and for nurses by 9 minutes, decreased hospital visits by an average of two days, and promoted equity. However, the exact magnitude of the impact remains uncertain.
Conclusion: This study identified a gap in the literature regarding a validated methodology for redesigning care pathways with (digital) technologies. The qualitative methodologies found in the literature were largely incorporated into the Rijnstate approach. In the case study, the Rijnstate approach was enhanced with data analytics, which complements the defined approach by providing insights at the population level and offering more objectivity compared to the other methodologies. Data could assist in the redesign process and the estimates of its potential impact. However, the burden of data analytics may outweigh the benefits if the necessary data is not available or unreliable. Further efforts should focus on incorporating generative AI, as it might alleviate the time-consuming nature of data analysis and assist project teams in the redesign.",Master Health Sciences (M-HS),"Berg, Loes.J.J. van den",March 2025,English,"No.

face electromyography (HD-EMG) provides insights into neural
control of movement. However, variations in motor unit action potential (MUAP) shape during dynamic conditions, such as walking, pose challenges for decomposition accuracy. This thesis presents an adaptive framework to address these challenges, focusing on the m. soleus in walking.
The framework consists of: (1) an offline procedure to
extract decomposition parameters from low-force isometric and walking trials, (2) an online-ready system applying these parameters in static and adaptive algorithms to estimate MU-specific activation dynamics, and (3) validation against intramuscular EMG (iEMG) benchmarks.
Results showed that static decomposition performed well at
lower speeds ( 0.6 m/s), while the adaptive algorithm improved robustness in dynamic conditions for processing windows ≥ 200 ms. When training and test datasets were from different trials, the adaptive method significantly outperformed the static approach. This adaptive approach enables real-time tracking of m. soleus motor unit activity, with applications in movement
analysis, rehabilitation and human-machine interfacing. Future research should optimize muscle parameters with greater MUAP variability and validate the method in impaired populations.

106021,The future of platform dominancy : Research on the effects and handling of platform power,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106021,"The increased dominance of digital platforms has created multiple concerns among policymakers and experts. These concerns regard the increasing power of digital platforms, the dangers of these platforms for user privacy, and the regulations not always being sufficient enough to contain this power. While prior research has already explored competition and power dynamics in the platform economy, little is known about the examination of power abuse and regulation that go with it. This study investigated the mechanisms through which platforms are able to establish and maintain market dominance, potential consequences of excessive platform power, and the effectiveness of current and possible future regulations to counter these platforms, through case study research on existing cases of platform power abuse, as well as expert interviews on the topic. The findings of the study show that platforms use network effects, monopolize on data, and pricing strategies to maintain a dominant position in the market, often at the cost of competition and consumer choice. Even though existing regulations, like the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the EU try and counter this excessive platform power, there remain challenges in regulating the platforms properly. This study contributes to existing literature by identifying different patterns of power abuse and proposing new and different policies to ensure a fair competition in the digital market.

106020,Exploring the Role of Agrobiodiversity on Drought Stress in Coffee Fields in Vietnam with Remote Sensing,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106020,"Vietnam is the second largest coffee producer in the world but is challenged by an increase in the frequency and severity of droughts. At the same time, coffee production is associated with negative impacts on the environment. Various coffee sustainability programs emphasise the inclusion and conservation of biodiversity in coffee fields to improve sustainability. Assessing biodiversity with exclusive use of field visits is challenging. Moreover, it is uncertain whether a correlation between agrobiodiversity and drought stress in coffee plants exists. Using remote sensing is promising as it offers a transparent and efficient method for both biodiversity assess- ments as well as drought stress assessments. Therefore, this thesis uses multi-spectral remote sensing to explore (1) its ability to assess agrobiodiversity in coffee fields with the use of im- age classification, (2) its ability to assess drought stress in coffee plants with NDVI and VCI indices, and (3) if a relationship between agrobiodiversity and droughts can be established with this approach. To validate the remote sensing results, fieldwork was used to (1) collect ground truth points for the image classification, and (2) examine correlations between agrobiodiversity traits and the health of coffee plants. Using the commune Quang Hiep as a case study area, field data revealed that an increase in shade from intercrop or shade trees was highly correlated with an increase in coffee plant health (r=0.70). The image classification results revealed that high-resolution SPOT 6 imagery, with NDVI as vegetation index and a Random Forest classi- fier, can distinguish between high-shade, low-shade, and no coffee areas with an overall accuracy of 80.03%. The drought stress analysis revealed that the NDVI map derived from Sentinel-2 imagery is moderately correlated with the observed health of coffee plants from the field data collection (r=0.34). Lastly, after comparing NDVI and VCI indices for the high-shade and low- shade intercrop coffee classes, results show higher values for high-shade intercrop coffee fields. Thus, healthier vegetation can be found in the areas classified as high-shade intercrop coffee. Although more research on optimal shade levels is necessary, these findings suggest that more shade in coffee fields may reduce drought stress. This research contributes to sustainable coffee farming practices, emphasising the possible benefits of agrobiodiversity for climate adaptation in agriculture and the possible use of remote sensing to assess this.",Master Spatial Engineering (M-SE),"Khan, Manuka",August 2024,English,"No

106019,EPG : Automating Model-to-Code Translation for micro-ROS and ROS 2,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106019,"Robotics, as a multidisciplinary field, requires expertise in control design, system modelling,
software development, and mechatronics, and often lacks integrated tools that combine these
domains efficiently. Existing tools address specific aspects, but no comprehensive solution

This thesis introduces the Embedded-Project Generator (EPG), a model-driven development (MDD) software tool designed to automate the creation of microcontroller-based projects. These EPG-generated projects are configured for real-time management of model-based mechatronic control software, and enable network connectivity between a robot, controlled by a microcontroller that uses micro-ROS to facilitate communication with ROS 2 on a coordinating single-board computer.
This thesis aims to automate the translation from a robot-controller model to code that uses the ROS 2 ecosystem and supports real-time control, implement the automation method in a software tool, evaluate its performance with a robot, and test the performance and stability of a distributed network with multiple robots using code generated by the software tool.
The EPG functions as intended and demonstrates the ability to generate projects with a 1 ms firm real-time control loop and 33 ms soft real-time communication. Networking tests demonstrate the effectiveness of a distributed system using EPG-generated projects, in achieving motion profile tracking, real-time synchronisation, and teleoperation.

106017,Design and Development of a Multi-Axis 3D Weaving Printer for Fiber-Reinforced Multi-Material Cylindrical Structures,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106017,"Fiber reinforcement in additive manufacturing is a promising approach to improving mechanical
properties in 3D-printed structures. However, the planar deposition process of conventional fused
deposition modeling (FDM) approaches has substantial restrictions on fiber alignment and placement.
To overcome these constraints and broaden applications in soft robotics and biomedical implants,
this thesis introduces the creation of a multi-axis 3D weaving system for embedding continuous
fibers into cylindrical structures.
In order to achieve this, this study investigates hardware changes to incorporate rotating degrees
of freedom into an already-existing FDM printer, allowing for automated fiber deposition in both axial
and circumferential directions. Included in these adjustments are nozzle extension, print bed support
optimization, and controlled fiber placement. Furthermore, a unique method for generating G-code
is created to support complex fiber patterns modeled after biological structures like the annulus
fibrosus and non-planar deposition techniques. The system’s performance is evaluated by analyzing
fiber alignment, loom deposition quality, and the influence of key parameters—including fiber spacing,
angles, and density—on the mechanical properties of the printed structures.
The results demonstrate how the implemented modifications influence fiber alignment and loom
deposition quality, revealing the impact of multi-axis motion on fiber placement accuracy and structural
consistency. Additionally, the study explores how fiber parameters, such as spacing, angles, and density, affect the mechanical properties of the printed structures, providing insights into optimizing
fiber reinforcement strategies. By proposing a scalable and automated methodology for fiber

106016,Assessing alternative discharge distributions at the Pannerdensche Kop and IJsselkop to address climate change impacts on the Dutch Rhine system by 2100,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106016,"The Dutch Rhine branches are among the most heavily engineered river systems in the world. 
Groynes, weirs, control structures, and flood channels are built to manage the flow and thereby 
support river functions such as conveyance, water supply, habitat, and transportation. In addition, the 
river system is affected by climate change. This is evident trough a change in the hydrograph. Extreme 
discharge events will be more extreme and occur more often. It is therefore questioned how the
discharge, both low and high flows, should be distributed over the three distributaries Waal, 
Nederrijn-Lek and IJssel.
This study concluded on performance indicators to include in the evaluation of the river functions. The 
conveyance capacity is quantified on the water level rise along the length of the river branch from the 
current design discharge to future design discharge. The fresh water supply of the river has been 
quantified on the low flows, the low flow durations, and the return periods. The contribution of the 
river to habitat has been investigated based on both the water depth dynamics in the floodplain, and 
the area of the floodplain. Lastly, the transportation of the river has been evaluated based on the 
number of days per year that the minimum water depths are exceeded.
Thereafter, this study evaluated the impacts of climate change using the 1D hydrodynamical model 
SOBEK and a Multi Criteria Analysis. The results have shown that based on the KNMI climate scenarios,
the river functionalities will depreciate except from habitat. Moreover, the scenarios showing a trend 
toward a drier future climate exhibit a larger negative impact on the river functions than the scenarios 
showing a trend toward a wetter future climate. Overall, the river functions are most vulnerable to a 
drier future climate in combination with high emissions. 
The design discharge at Lobith is expected to increase from 16,000 m3
/s to 18,000 m3
/s in the year 
2100. The current discharge distribution holds 2/3 towards the Waal, 2/9 toward the Nederrijn-Lek 
and 1/9 towards the IJssel. Based on literature and expert judgement, two alternative discharge 
distributions have been proposed where for both the Nederrijn-Lek is spared. The Nederrijn-Lek has 
relative narrow floodplains, is surrounded by ribbon development, and an increase in water levels 
along the Nederrijn-Lek will pose the larger flood risks than the Waal and IJssel. One scenario entails 
allocating 80% of the extra discharge to the Waal and 20% to the IJssel (80-20). The second scenario 
include a distribution of 60% to the Waal and 40% to the IJssel (60-40). 
The model results showed that in the context of a drier future climate and high emissions an alteration 
in the discharge distribution is advantageous. Also, the distribution 60-40 is optimal as this is better for 
the conveyance, habitat, and transport. 
A modification to the discharge distribution ratio from the current to 60-40 will result in an increase of 
discharge toward the Waal and IJssel. For this, three types of river widening measures have been 
proposed along the IJssel to account for the additional discharge. Including a dike relocation, the 
excavation of the floodplains and the lowering of the main channel have been investigated. 
Additionally, the model results showed that a dike relocation and excavation of the floodplain do have 
a favourable impact on the river functions in the drier climate scenario based on high emissions. 
Contrary, excavating the main channel will have negative effects on the functions: habitat and 
transportation.
In conclusion, it is important to further investigate the technical feasibility of altering the discharge 
distribution for the additional 2,000 m3
/s design discharge and investigate the impacts outside of the 
scope of this study. Lastly, it is advised to critically reserve space for the river and investigate whether 
smaller interventions can yield the same effect on the river functions as either of two large scale river 
widening interventions.",Master Civil Engineering and Management (M-CEM),"Schoonderwoerd, L.M.",March 2025,English,"No

106009,Development of Task-Level Programming Framework for Learning from Demonstration,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106009,"As robotic systems become more integrated into dynamic environments, enabling non-expert users
to intuitively program robots remains a challenge. Learning from Demonstration (LfD) offers a
promising solution by allowing robots to acquire skills through human demonstrations instead of
explicit programming. Effectively storing and exploiting past user demonstrations is a fundamental challenge. A solution to this challenge is the organization of demonstrations in a skill library.
However, this requires robust segmentation, classification, and novelty detection techniques to ensure effective learning and reusability.
This thesis presents a modular framework for skill recognition, segmentation, and novelty detection. The framework enables robots to identify and classify demonstrated motions by matching
them to skills in a predefined skill library, ensuring that non-expert users can intuitively program
robotic tasks. The system incorporates time series classification using Detach-ROCKET, change
point detection for motion segmentation, and novelty detection to identify previously unseen skills.
User confirmation is integrated into the process to improve robustness and ensure reliability despite
imperfections in human demonstrations.
The framework is evaluated using position data of motion demonstrations recorded with the Franka
Research 3 robotic arm via kinesthetic teaching. Results indicate that Detach-ROCKET with
MINIROCKET kernels provides high classification accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Segmentation methods, including Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) segmentation and
binary segmentation, exhibit robust segmentation. Additionally, novelty detection using Local
Outlier Factor (LOF) effectively identifies new skills, enabling the expansion of the skill library.
By improving skill recognition and segmentation, this framework enhances the usability of LfD,
making robot programming more accessible to non-experts. The relevance of this thesis extends
beyond technical challenges. It also plays a role in making robotics more accessible in industries
facing labor shortages. Future work could explore integrating additional contextual information
and alternative teaching methods to further refine the learning process.",Master Mechanical Engineering (M-ME),"Dankers, E.J.C.M.",March 2025,English,"No.

106007,Encouraging Stair Use : How to Motivate People to Choose Stairs Over the Elevator?,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106007,"Physical inactivity is a growing concern, especially at universities, where students and 
employees tend to spend the majority of their day sitting. It can have negative effects on 
health, from increasing the risk of chronic diseases to deterioration of mental well-being. 
A simple and accessible way of tackling this issue is to encourage stair use, as taking 
the stairs is a significantly healthier option than using the elevator. Unlike standing still in 
an elevator, stair-climbing requires physical activity, which is beneficial for health.
This research aimed to design an interactive installation that motivates people to take the 
stairs. It examined the different types of motivation that make people act, techniques of 
influencing behaviour with design, and existing interventions. Ultimately, it focused on 
fostering intrinsic motivation, which was found to be the most promising way of 
encouraging stair use.
The chosen concept, Digital Garden, was an installation which visually responded to 
people taking the stairs. It reacted to the user’s location, spawning sprouts in a virtual 
garden when the users began climbing the stairs and transforming the sprouts into full 
plants when the users reached the top. The garden visualization was displayed on two
screens placed next to the staircase. This concept aimed to foster intrinsic motivation by 
making the stair-climbing experience more interesting and enjoyable.
The installation was evaluated through usability testing and a controlled experiment, 
which involved twenty participants who climbed the stairs under two conditions, once with 
and once without the installation. A questionnaire, behavioural measure, and interviews 
were used to collect data and asses the product’s impact on the stair-climbing experience 
and intrinsic motivation. The findings showed a significant increase in interest and 
enjoyment of climbing the stairs with the installation, as well as a higher likelihood of 
participants choosing to take the stairs again. The results also indicated the installation’s 
success in targeting intrinsic motivation.
Despite these promising findings, further research is needed to assess the installation’s 
true impact on users in a real-world environment. Longitudinal studies should also be 
conducted to evaluate its long-term effects. Nevertheless, the results indicated that the 
Digital Garden has great potential to encourage stair use, making it a promising approach

Measuring reputation is complex due to the halo effect, where an overall impression distorts evaluations of individual attributes. This study examines how the halo effect impacts corporate reputation assessments across two measurement approaches: survey-based research and social listening-based analysis. Method: A comparative analysis of secondary data from ten large German companies was conducted using structured surveys and social listening tools. Correlation and regression analyses assessed interdimensional relationships and the prominence of specific reputation dimensions. Results: Survey-based reputation assessments showed higher interdimensional correlations, indicating greater susceptibility to the halo effect. Respondents tended to evaluate dimensions based on general impressions rather than distinct attributes. Conversely, social listening-based assessments exhibited lower correlations, suggesting a more independent evaluation of reputation dimensions. Regression analyses revealed varying importance levels of different reputation dimensions, with products and services being especially influential. Conclusion: These findings highlight key methodological differences in reputation measurement. Survey-based methods, while useful for broad reputation assessments, are more prone to halo effects.

106000,"The role of digital skills, technology exposure, and social security in shaping automation fears across Europe",https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/106000,"This thesis investigates the role of digital skills, exposure to technology, and social security in shaping fear of automation in European countries. With the rise of technologies in the 4th industrial revolution, fears of job loss are growing. Using data from the Eurobarometer 87.1 survey and Eurostat, multilevel regression analysis is employed to assess relationships between digital skills, exposure to technology, and fear of automation at the individual level, while considering the moderating role of social security. The sample includes individuals aged 15 to 65 across 28 EU countries. Findings show that individuals with higher digital skills have less fear of automation and can adapt better to new technologies. Exposure to technology, both at home and at work, also correlates negatively with fear of automation, with stronger effects at work. Social security, measured by unemployment benefits per capita, shows a moderating effect on the relationship between digital skills and automation fear, especially for those with lower digital skills. This thesis provides valuable insights for governments and organizations navigating the future of work in an increasingly automated labor market.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Overbeek, T.M.W.",March 2025,English,"No

Therefore, staff scheduling should be performed accordingly to ensure sufficient capacity to handle the scheduled activities. In this thesis, we present an alternative approach to schedule staff, focusing on improvement of the model formulation to improve the computational performance. Subsequently, we extend the model to optimize over different possible scenarios that might occur at the airport, improving the schedules robustness against deviations. We scope our experiments to the baggage handlers of the ground operations department, but note that extension to other departments is viable. We find that applying a stochastic programming approach can save around 10% of costs, capturing the majority of the cost savings, as only 7% of further cost savings can be achieved if schedule deviations are known. Furthermore, we find the advantages of allowing exchangeability of employees between departments to be able to save a further 8% of costs, indicating the importance of flexibility. Lastly, we present a robust model that allows the user to explicitly set boundaries on the percentage of certainty that enough employees are present for the activities.",Master Industrial Engineering and Management (M-IEM),"Assink, J.G.",March 2025,English,"No.

105992,Optimizing Workforce Management : Analyzing Generational Preferences for Flexible Work Arrangements in a Manufacturing Setting,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/105992,"This study examines different flexible work arrangements (FWAs) and their impacts, with a particular focus on how generational differences influence employee satisfaction and productivity in the manufacturing industry. With demographic shifts, like an aging workforce and the entry of younger generations, in combination with fast technological advancements, the workforce is becoming more diverse and dynamic, this requires organizations to adapt their management strategies to meet evolving employee needs and operational demands. For these optimal workforce management strategies, understanding the generational preferences and barriers has become very important. The research looks at the following generations: Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z. In this research, their view on FWAs such as Flexible Hours, Compressed Workweeks, and Phased Retirement will be examined. It uses a quantitative approach supplemented by open-ended question used to study the intersections of generational differences, FWAs usage, and employment foundation outcomes such as satisfaction and productivity. The findings reveal nuanced generational preferences, highlighting the complexity of implementing FWAs in a manufacturing setting. Rather than focusing primarily on generational differences, the results emphasize the need for a broader, more flexible approach. Although the results of looking for generational differences were not statistically significant, the data provided valuable insights into the use and interest in FWA policies across generations. There were interesting patterns in the interest expressed in certain FWAs, for example that younger employees showed a bigger interest in flexible hours compared to older employees. These results may not strongly predict FWA usage, but it could still improve employee satisfaction and productivity by fitting policies to individual and role-specific needs. Since this study shows the interesting insights on how different generations react and utilize FWAs, it can contribute to the existing body of literature around this topic, showing real world results on how flexible arrangements have an impact on a multigenerational workforce in the manufacturing setting.",Master Business Administration (M-BA),"Droste, C.H.H.",March 2025,English,"No

105990,Building a visualisation tool for an organ-on-a-chip model of fibrotic diseases,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/105990,"Fibrotic disorders, responsible for approximately 45% of deaths in developed countries, present significant challenges in medical research and treatment development. While organ-on-chip (OoC) technology offers promising alternatives to traditional research models for studying fibrosis, their microscopic size and maintenance requirements limit their use in educational and communication contexts. This study aimed to develop and evaluate an interactive visualisation tool to enhance understanding of organ-on-chip models and fibrosis, addressing how 3D digital visualisation tools can effectively illustrate fibrotic disease progression and accurately represent organ-on-chip models. The project began with literature research to understand the biological and technological aspects of fibrosis and OoC. Based on this, the ideation and specification phases led to the visualisation tool. During the realisation phase, a hybrid interactive tool combining elements of a game with a structured educational experience was created. This tool utilised interactive 3D models, animations, and dialogue systems to explain the concept of fibrosis and introduce the OoC model. The evaluation phase involved user testing with eleven participants across different age groups, educational backgrounds, and levels of medical knowledge. Results showed that the tool was effective in educating users about fibrosis and the organ-on-chip model. The System Usability Scale score of 76.67 indicated good usability. The tool successfully communicated complex scientific concepts to users with varying levels and types of expertise, with participants particularly valuing the freedom to explore and step-by-step learning process. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that interactive 3D visualisations can bridge the gap between complex biological processes and advanced technological developments, making them more accessible for educational communication. The tool effectively supported learning outcomes, proving useful in enhancing understanding of fibrotic disease and organ-on-chip technology. Future developments should focus on improving the platform's adaptability to various user levels and expanding its scope to cover additional organ systems and fibrosis types.",Bachelor Creative Technology (B-CREA),"Broek, E.M. van den",February 2025,English,"No

105988,Mobile-based Third-wave Therapies for Working Adults : A Scoping Review of Randomised Controlled Trials,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/105988,"Mobile health applications are popular for offering affordable and scalable therapies among the working population. Prior research has mainly focused on cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT) or web-based interventions. There is limited knowledge of the implementation of third-wave therapies (TWT) and its elements among this target group. Earlier research has suggested that third wave- and traditional CBT elements were integrated among interventions. This indicates that TWT cannot be considered a unified set of therapies and justly distinguished from CBT. To my knowledge, no research has evaluated this gap among the working population. A scoping review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Searching of the literature was done in Scopus, PsycInfo, and Web of Science. Papers needed to include mobile health applications and dialectical behaviour therapy, mindfulness, metacognitive therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, functional analytical psychotherapy, behavioural activation, or positive psychotherapy. 518 articles were screened, and 20 papers were included. 10644 participants were reviewed, who were predominantly female and worked in the healthcare sector. Mindfulness was identified among eight studies. Among seven studies, both third wave elements and CBT elements were included. Psychological outcomes were depression (N=14), stress (N=12), anxiety (N=12), and well-being (N=13), which reported positive effects of TWTs. Mindfulness elements were implemented the most, however, several interventions included third wave and CBT, implying that TWTS are difficult to view as an independent paradigm.

105987,Drivers and Barriers Affecting the Acceptance and Adoption of EMH by Mental Health Professionals during and after COVID-19: a Scoping Review,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/105987,"Background: The acceptance and adoption of e-mental health (EMH) by mental health professionals is increasing due to awareness of its benefits and accessibility to mental health care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face care was not possible due to the restrictions, which also increased the use of EMH tools. Objective: We aim to conduct a scoping review to identify the research gap regarding the drivers and barriers to the acceptance and adoption of EMH among mental health professionals, focusing on literature from 2020-2024, to also examine the requirements of change to improve the adoption of
EMH. Methods: Three databases were searched between 2020-2024 for research articles meeting the predefined inclusion criteria containing drivers and barriers of acceptance and adoption of e-mental health interventions among mental health professionals. Results: The findings suggested that the most common drivers experienced by mental health professionals were flexibility, general work experience, EMH experience by psychologists, and self-help enhancement. The most common barriers found in the studies were technical challenges, fatigue because of using online tools, and professional challenges. The results also found the need for better training, tools, and implementation guidelines to support the adoption of EMH. Conclusion: Current drivers and barriers affecting mental health professionals’ acceptance and adoption of EMH have been identified, such as the relatively new barrier fatigue that was brought to light after COVID-19. The findings imply that while the COVID-19 pandemic may have temporarily increased the necessity for EMH use, it did not lead to a fundamental shift in psychologists' perspectives or intrinsic motivations for using EMH. Research on the long-
term effects of fatigue due to EMH, personal traits affecting EMH acceptance, and strategies to bridge the gap in experience with using EMH can help with being able to utilize EMH more effectively and more frequently by mental health professionals.",Master Psychology (M-PSY),"Wullink, C.",January 2025,English,"No.

105985,Development and testing of a Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation infrastructure,https://essay.utwente.nl/#/view/105985,"A Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) simulation setup contains a real-time simulator that runs models or systems at the same pace as real life, allowing instant feedback and interaction. In the
setup, (part of) a plant is simulated in real-time and used to test an implemented controller.
This has safety benefits as it allows thorough testing of the implemented controller without
damaging the real system or its surroundings. It also has benefits with regards to costs. In education numerous expensive setups are required when teaching students but HiL simulation
enables the replacement of the expensive setups with cheaper Digital Twins. HiL is a helpful
tool in Embedded Control System (ECS) development as it bridges the gap between the theoretical simulation and the physical implementation.
The goal of this project is to develop and test a HiL simulation infrastructure. This infrastructure enables HiL simulation for various applications. It contains contributions to the real-time
Xenomai framework as well as user guides and recommendations that enable users to perform
HiL simulation of their own application. The second goal is to use this infrastructure to develop a Digital Twin of the RELbot which is a mobile robot frequently used at the Robotics and
Mechatronics research group. This mobile robot has two motors driving two wheels and it has
a castor wheel. The third goal is to measure performance of the Digital Twin with a credibility
assessment method that generates a score between 0 % and 100 %.
This project uses a Raspberry Pi 4 with an Icoboard FPGA as the hardware for the Digital Twin.
This hardware combination is also used by the ECS. An existing real-time framework developed
for the ECS has been used and expanded for use on Digital Twins. This framework facilitates
a firm real-time loop on a Raspberry Pi and enables communication to the FPGAs and other
components in the setup.
The HiL infrastructure has been developed and tested and a Digital Twin of the RELbot has
been developed. Two types of tests have been performed. Firstly, the 20-Sim simulation has
been compared with the results of the Digital Twin. This shows how well the 20-Sim simulation
on a computer compares to a real-time capable model on a Raspberry Pi. Secondly, the Digital
Twin has been compared with the real RELbot to determine if the RELbot model that has been
developed is good enough and if the Digital Twin as a whole has good performance.
The results from the first set of tests show that the difference in output between the 20-Sim
simulation and the Digital Twin simulation is 7 × 10−3 %. This is a really small error and it is
below the 1 % difference requirement. The results from the second set of tests show that the
difference in output between the Digital Twin and the RELbot is 1 %. This is also a really small
error and meets the requirement of an error below 5%.
The credibility assessment method was used to generate a score for the Digital Twin. The credibility score of the Digital Twin is 97 %.
In conclusion, the goals are achieved and the requirements are met. The HiL simulation infrastructure can be used to develop Digital Twins. The Digital Twin of the RELbot can be used in
education. The credibility assessment of the Digital Twin is also completed.
It is recommended to improve the RELbot model by choosing more suitable reference frames
and modeling the wheels as separate rigid bodies. It is recommended to expand the Digital
Twin framework with a Quality-of-Service check that tracks missed deadlines and informs the
user of unreliable results when too many missed deadlines occur. It is also recommended to
expand the live visualisation of the RELbot to include the angle of the RELbot. The final recommendation is to test the infrastructure with different plants.",Master Systems and Control (M-SC),"Hooglander, Frank",March 2025,English,"No
